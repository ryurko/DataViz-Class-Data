768,CHAPTER I,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,1801—I have just returned from a visit to my landlord—the solitary,Wuthering Heights
768,neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful,Wuthering Heights
768,"country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a",Wuthering Heights
768,situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect,Wuthering Heights
768,misanthropist’s Heaven—and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable,Wuthering Heights
768,pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little,Wuthering Heights
768,imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes,Wuthering Heights
768,"withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his",Wuthering Heights
768,"fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further",Wuthering Heights
768,"in his waistcoat, as I announced my name.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Mr. Heathcliff?” I said.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,A nod was the answer.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir. I do myself the honour of calling",Wuthering Heights
768,"as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have",Wuthering Heights
768,not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation,Wuthering Heights
768,of Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts—”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,” he interrupted, wincing. “I should",Wuthering Heights
768,"not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it—walk in!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The “walk in” was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the",Wuthering Heights
768,"sentiment, “Go to the Deuce!” even the gate over which he leant",Wuthering Heights
768,manifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that,Wuthering Heights
768,circumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested,Wuthering Heights
768,in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"When he saw my horse’s breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put",Wuthering Heights
768,"out his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the",Wuthering Heights
768,"causeway, calling, as we entered the court,—“Joseph, take Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,Lockwood’s horse; and bring up some wine.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,” was the",Wuthering Heights
768,reflection suggested by this compound order. “No wonder the grass grows,Wuthering Heights
768,"up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man, very old, perhaps, though hale",Wuthering Heights
768,and sinewy. “The Lord help us!” he soliloquised in an undertone of,Wuthering Heights
768,"peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime,",Wuthering Heights
768,in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of,Wuthering Heights
768,"divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no",Wuthering Heights
768,reference to my unexpected advent.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling. “Wuthering”,Wuthering Heights
768,"being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the",Wuthering Heights
768,atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed:",Wuthering Heights
768,"one may guess the power of the north wind, blowing over the edge, by",Wuthering Heights
768,the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and,Wuthering Heights
768,"by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if",Wuthering Heights
768,"craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build",Wuthering Heights
768,"it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the",Wuthering Heights
768,corners defended with large jutting stones.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of",Wuthering Heights
768,"grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the",Wuthering Heights
768,"principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins",Wuthering Heights
768,"and shameless little boys, I detected the date “1500,” and the name",Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hareton Earnshaw.” I would have made a few comments, and requested a",Wuthering Heights
768,short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at,Wuthering Heights
768,"the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure,",Wuthering Heights
768,and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting,Wuthering Heights
768,the penetralium.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"One step brought us into the family sitting-room, without any",Wuthering Heights
768,introductory lobby or passage: they call it here “the house”,Wuthering Heights
768,"pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I",Wuthering Heights
768,believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat,Wuthering Heights
768,altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of,Wuthering Heights
768,"tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge",Wuthering Heights
768,fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on,Wuthering Heights
768,"the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat",Wuthering Heights
768,"from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and",Wuthering Heights
768,"tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very",Wuthering Heights
768,roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay,Wuthering Heights
768,"bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with",Wuthering Heights
768,"oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of",Wuthering Heights
768,"horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily painted canisters",Wuthering Heights
768,"disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the",Wuthering Heights
768,"chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two",Wuthering Heights
768,heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser,Wuthering Heights
768,"reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of",Wuthering Heights
768,squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as,Wuthering Heights
768,"belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance,",Wuthering Heights
768,and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Such an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on",Wuthering Heights
768,"the round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six",Wuthering Heights
768,"miles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner. But",Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of,Wuthering Heights
768,"living. He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a",Wuthering Heights
768,"gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire:",Wuthering Heights
768,"rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence,",Wuthering Heights
768,because he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Possibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred",Wuthering Heights
768,pride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of,Wuthering Heights
768,"the sort: I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to",Wuthering Heights
768,showy displays of feeling—to manifestations of mutual kindliness. He’ll,Wuthering Heights
768,"love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of",Wuthering Heights
768,"impertinence to be loved or hated again. No, I’m running on too fast: I",Wuthering Heights
768,bestow my own attributes over-liberally on him. Mr. Heathcliff may have,Wuthering Heights
768,entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he,Wuthering Heights
768,"meets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me. Let me hope",Wuthering Heights
768,my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should,Wuthering Heights
768,never have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself,Wuthering Heights
768,perfectly unworthy of one.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown",Wuthering Heights
768,into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my,Wuthering Heights
768,"eyes, as long as she took no notice of me. I “never told my love”",Wuthering Heights
768,"vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have",Wuthering Heights
768,"guessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked",Wuthering Heights
768,a return—the sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I,Wuthering Heights
768,"confess it with shame—shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every",Wuthering Heights
768,glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was,Wuthering Heights
768,"led to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her",Wuthering Heights
768,"supposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of,Wuthering Heights
768,"deliberate heartlessness; how undeserved, I alone can appreciate.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which,Wuthering Heights
768,"my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by",Wuthering Heights
768,"attempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long,",Wuthering Heights
768,guttural gnarl.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’d better let the dog alone,” growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison,",Wuthering Heights
768,checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. “She’s not,Wuthering Heights
768,"accustomed to be spoiled—not kept for a pet.” Then, striding to a side",Wuthering Heights
768,"door, he shouted again, “Joseph!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no",Wuthering Heights
768,"intimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me",Wuthering Heights
768,"_vis-à-vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs,",Wuthering Heights
768,who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not,Wuthering Heights
768,"anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but,",Wuthering Heights
768,"imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately",Wuthering Heights
768,"indulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my",Wuthering Heights
768,"physiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and",Wuthering Heights
768,"leapt on my knees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the",Wuthering Heights
768,table between us. This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen,Wuthering Heights
768,"four-footed fiends, of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens",Wuthering Heights
768,to the common centre. I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects,Wuthering Heights
768,of assault; and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I,Wuthering Heights
768,"could with the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance",Wuthering Heights
768,from some of the household in re-establishing peace.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious,Wuthering Heights
768,"phlegm: I don’t think they moved one second faster than usual, though",Wuthering Heights
768,"the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an",Wuthering Heights
768,"inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch; a lusty dame, with",Wuthering Heights
768,"tucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the",Wuthering Heights
768,"midst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her",Wuthering Heights
768,"tongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she",Wuthering Heights
768,"only remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master",Wuthering Heights
768,entered on the scene.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What the devil is the matter?” he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I",Wuthering Heights
768,could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What the devil, indeed!” I muttered. “The herd of possessed swine",Wuthering Heights
768,"could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours,",Wuthering Heights
768,sir. You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“They won’t meddle with persons who touch nothing,” he remarked,",Wuthering Heights
768,"putting the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table. “The",Wuthering Heights
768,dogs do right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, thank you.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Not bitten, are you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.” Heathcliff’s",Wuthering Heights
768,countenance relaxed into a grin.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Come, come,” he said, “you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood. Here, take a",Wuthering Heights
768,little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my,Wuthering Heights
768,"dogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them. Your",Wuthering Heights
768,"health, sir?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be,Wuthering Heights
768,"foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides,",Wuthering Heights
768,I felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since,Wuthering Heights
768,his humour took that turn. He—probably swayed by prudential,Wuthering Heights
768,consideration of the folly of offending a good tenant—relaxed a little,Wuthering Heights
768,"in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me,—a",Wuthering Heights
768,discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of,Wuthering Heights
768,retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and,Wuthering Heights
768,"before I went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another",Wuthering Heights
768,visit to-morrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"shall go, notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself",Wuthering Heights
768,compared with him.,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER II,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend,Wuthering Heights
768,"it by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to",Wuthering Heights
768,"Wuthering Heights. On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.—I dine",Wuthering Heights
768,"between twelve and one o’clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken",Wuthering Heights
768,"as a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend",Wuthering Heights
768,my request that I might be served at five)—on mounting the stairs with,Wuthering Heights
768,"this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl",Wuthering Heights
768,"on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an",Wuthering Heights
768,infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.,Wuthering Heights
768,"This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a",Wuthering Heights
768,"four-miles’ walk, arrived at Heathcliff’s garden-gate just in time to",Wuthering Heights
768,escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"On that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the",Wuthering Heights
768,air made me shiver through every limb. Being unable to remove the,Wuthering Heights
768,"chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered",Wuthering Heights
768,"with straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till",Wuthering Heights
768,my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Wretched inmates!” I ejaculated, mentally, “you deserve perpetual",Wuthering Heights
768,"isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least,",Wuthering Heights
768,I would not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don’t care—I will,Wuthering Heights
768,"get in!” So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.",Wuthering Heights
768,Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the,Wuthering Heights
768,barn.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What are ye for?” he shouted. “T’ maister’s down i’ t’ fowld. Go round,Wuthering Heights
768,"by th’ end o’ t’ laith, if ye went to spake to him.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is there nobody inside to open the door?” I hallooed, responsively.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“There’s nobbut t’ missis; and shoo’ll not oppen ’t an ye mak’ yer,Wuthering Heights
768,flaysome dins till neeght.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why? Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nor-ne me! I’ll hae no hend wi’t,” muttered the head, vanishing.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The snow began to drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another,Wuthering Heights
768,"trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork,",Wuthering Heights
768,"appeared in the yard behind. He hailed me to follow him, and, after",Wuthering Heights
768,"marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed,",Wuthering Heights
768,"pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful",Wuthering Heights
768,apartment where I was formerly received. It glowed delightfully in the,Wuthering Heights
768,"radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"near the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to",Wuthering Heights
768,"observe the “missis,” an individual whose existence I had never",Wuthering Heights
768,"previously suspected. I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me",Wuthering Heights
768,"take a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained",Wuthering Heights
768,motionless and mute.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Rough weather!” I remarked. “I’m afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door",Wuthering Heights
768,must bear the consequence of your servants’ leisure attendance: I had,Wuthering Heights
768,hard work to make them hear me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She never opened her mouth. I stared—she stared also: at any rate, she",Wuthering Heights
768,"kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly",Wuthering Heights
768,embarrassing and disagreeable.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Sit down,” said the young man, gruffly. “He’ll be in soon.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this",Wuthering Heights
768,"second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of",Wuthering Heights
768,owning my acquaintance.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“A beautiful animal!” I commenced again. “Do you intend parting with,Wuthering Heights
768,"the little ones, madam?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“They are not mine,” said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff himself could have replied.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ah, your favourites are among these?” I continued, turning to an",Wuthering Heights
768,obscure cushion full of something like cats.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“A strange choice of favourites!” she observed scornfully.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew",Wuthering Heights
768,"closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the",Wuthering Heights
768,evening.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You should not have come out,” she said, rising and reaching from the",Wuthering Heights
768,chimney-piece two of the painted canisters.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct",Wuthering Heights
768,"view of her whole figure and countenance. She was slender, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most",Wuthering Heights
768,exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding;,Wuthering Heights
768,"small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging",Wuthering Heights
768,"loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in",Wuthering Heights
768,"expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my",Wuthering Heights
768,"susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between",Wuthering Heights
768,"scorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected",Wuthering Heights
768,there. The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to,Wuthering Heights
768,aid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted,Wuthering Heights
768,to assist him in counting his gold.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I don’t want your help,” she snapped; “I can get them for myself.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“I beg your pardon!” I hastened to reply.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Were you asked to tea?” she demanded, tying an apron over her neat",Wuthering Heights
768,"black frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the",Wuthering Heights
768,pot.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I shall be glad to have a cup,” I answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Were you asked?” she repeated.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” I said, half smiling. “You are the proper person to ask me.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet;",Wuthering Heights
768,"her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a",Wuthering Heights
768,child’s ready to cry.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby",Wuthering Heights
768,"upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on",Wuthering Heights
768,"me from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some",Wuthering Heights
768,mortal feud unavenged between us. I began to doubt whether he were a,Wuthering Heights
768,"servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of",Wuthering Heights
768,the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown,Wuthering Heights
768,"curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly",Wuthering Heights
768,"over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common",Wuthering Heights
768,"labourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed",Wuthering Heights
768,none of a domestic’s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.,Wuthering Heights
768,"In the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to",Wuthering Heights
768,"abstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes",Wuthering Heights
768,"afterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure,",Wuthering Heights
768,from my uncomfortable state.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!” I exclaimed, assuming",Wuthering Heights
768,"the cheerful; “and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if",Wuthering Heights
768,you can afford me shelter during that space.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Half an hour?” he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; “I",Wuthering Heights
768,wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in.,Wuthering Heights
768,Do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes? People,Wuthering Heights
768,familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I,Wuthering Heights
768,can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the",Wuthering Heights
768,Grange till morning—could you spare me one?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, I could not.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, indeed! Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Umph!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Are you going to mak’ the tea?” demanded he of the shabby coat,",Wuthering Heights
768,shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is _he_ to have any?” she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Get it ready, will you?” was the answer, uttered so savagely that I",Wuthering Heights
768,started. The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad,Wuthering Heights
768,nature. I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.,Wuthering Heights
768,"When the preparations were finished, he invited me with—“Now, sir,",Wuthering Heights
768,"bring forward your chair.” And we all, including the rustic youth, drew",Wuthering Heights
768,round the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our,Wuthering Heights
768,meal.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort",Wuthering Heights
768,to dispel it. They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it,Wuthering Heights
768,"was impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal",Wuthering Heights
768,scowl they wore was their every-day countenance.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is strange,” I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea",Wuthering Heights
768,and receiving another—“it is strange how custom can mould our tastes,Wuthering Heights
768,and ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life,Wuthering Heights
768,"of such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff;",Wuthering Heights
768,"yet, I’ll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with",Wuthering Heights
768,your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart—”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“My amiable lady!” he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on",Wuthering Heights
768,his face. “Where is she—my amiable lady?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, yes—oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of",Wuthering Heights
768,"ministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even",Wuthering Heights
768,when her body is gone. Is that it?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it. I might have",Wuthering Heights
768,seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to,Wuthering Heights
768,make it likely that they were man and wife. One was about forty: a,Wuthering Heights
768,period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of,Wuthering Heights
768,being married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace,Wuthering Heights
768,of our declining years. The other did not look seventeen.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Then it flashed upon me—“The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea",Wuthering Heights
768,"out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her",Wuthering Heights
768,"husband: Heathcliff junior, of course. Here is the consequence of being",Wuthering Heights
768,buried alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer,Wuthering Heights
768,ignorance that better individuals existed! A sad pity—I must beware how,Wuthering Heights
768,I cause her to regret her choice.” The last reflection may seem,Wuthering Heights
768,conceited; it was not. My neighbour struck me as bordering on,Wuthering Heights
768,"repulsive; I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,” said Heathcliff, corroborating",Wuthering Heights
768,"my surmise. He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a",Wuthering Heights
768,look of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles,Wuthering Heights
768,"that will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of",Wuthering Heights
768,his soul.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ah, certainly—I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"beneficent fairy,” I remarked, turning to my neighbour.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his",Wuthering Heights
768,"fist, with every appearance of a meditated assault. But he seemed to",Wuthering Heights
768,"recollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse,",Wuthering Heights
768,"muttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,” observed my host; “we neither of us",Wuthering Heights
768,have the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead. I said,Wuthering Heights
768,"she was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And this young man is—”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Not my son, assuredly.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to",Wuthering Heights
768,attribute the paternity of that bear to him.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“My name is Hareton Earnshaw,” growled the other; “and I’d counsel you",Wuthering Heights
768,to respect it!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ve shown no disrespect,” was my reply, laughing internally at the",Wuthering Heights
768,dignity with which he announced himself.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for",Wuthering Heights
768,fear I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity,Wuthering Heights
768,audible. I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant,Wuthering Heights
768,"family circle. The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than",Wuthering Heights
768,"neutralised, the glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to",Wuthering Heights
768,be cautious how I ventured under those rafters a third time.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of",Wuthering Heights
768,"sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather. A",Wuthering Heights
768,"sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and",Wuthering Heights
768,hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I don’t think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,” I",Wuthering Heights
768,"could not help exclaiming. “The roads will be buried already; and, if",Wuthering Heights
768,"they were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch. They’ll be",Wuthering Heights
768,"covered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,”",Wuthering Heights
768,said Heathcliff.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“How must I do?” I continued, with rising irritation.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only,Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff",Wuthering Heights
768,"leaning over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of",Wuthering Heights
768,matches which had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the,Wuthering Heights
768,"tea-canister to its place. The former, when he had deposited his",Wuthering Heights
768,"burden, took a critical survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated",Wuthering Heights
768,"out—“Aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i’ idleness un war,",Wuthering Heights
768,"when all on ’ems goan out! Bud yah’re a nowt, and it’s no use",Wuthering Heights

768,like yer mother afore ye!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to",Wuthering Heights
768,"me; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an",Wuthering Heights
768,"intention of kicking him out of the door. Mrs. Heathcliff, however,",Wuthering Heights
768,checked me by her answer.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“You scandalous old hypocrite!” she replied. “Are you not afraid of,Wuthering Heights
768,"being carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil’s name? I",Wuthering Heights
768,"warn you to refrain from provoking me, or I’ll ask your abduction as a",Wuthering Heights
768,"special favour! Stop! look here, Joseph,” she continued, taking a long,",Wuthering Heights
768,dark book from a shelf; “I’ll show you how far I’ve progressed in the,Wuthering Heights
768,Black Art: I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it. The,Wuthering Heights

768,reckoned among providential visitations!”,Wuthering Heights

768,"“No, reprobate! you are a castaway—be off, or I’ll hurt you seriously!",Wuthering Heights
768,I’ll have you all modelled in wax and clay! and the first who passes,Wuthering Heights

768,"you’ll see! Go, I’m looking at you!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and",Wuthering Heights
768,ejaculating “wicked” as he went. I thought her conduct must be prompted,Wuthering Heights
768,"by a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured",Wuthering Heights
768,to interest her in my distress.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mrs. Heathcliff,” I said earnestly, “you must excuse me for troubling",Wuthering Heights
768,"you. I presume, because, with that face, I’m sure you cannot help being",Wuthering Heights
768,good-hearted. Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way,Wuthering Heights
768,home: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to,Wuthering Heights
768,get to London!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Take the road you came,” she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair,",Wuthering Heights
768,"with a candle, and the long book open before her. “It is brief advice,",Wuthering Heights
768,but as sound as I can give.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full",Wuthering Heights
768,"of snow, your conscience won’t whisper that it is partly your fault?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“How so? I cannot escort you. They wouldn’t let me go to the end of the,Wuthering Heights
768,garden wall.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“_You_! I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold, for my",Wuthering Heights
768,"convenience, on such a night,” I cried. “I want you to _tell_ me my",Wuthering Heights

768,guide.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Who? There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I. Which would you",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Are there no boys at the farm?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“No; those are all.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“That you may settle with your host. I have nothing to do with it.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on,Wuthering Heights
768,"these hills,” cried Heathcliff’s stern voice from the kitchen entrance.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“As to staying here, I don’t keep accommodations for visitors: you must",Wuthering Heights
768,"share a bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I can sleep on a chair in this room,” I replied.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, no! A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor: it will not suit",Wuthering Heights
768,me to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!” said,Wuthering Heights
768,the unmannerly wretch.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,With this insult my patience was at an end. I uttered an expression of,Wuthering Heights
768,"disgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in",Wuthering Heights
768,"my haste. It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"as I wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour",Wuthering Heights
768,amongst each other. At first the young man appeared about to befriend,Wuthering Heights
768,me.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ll go with him as far as the park,” he said.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’ll go with him to hell!” exclaimed his master, or whatever",Wuthering Heights
768,"relation he bore. “And who is to look after the horses, eh?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“A man’s life is of more consequence than one evening’s neglect of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"horses: somebody must go,” murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I",Wuthering Heights
768,expected.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Not at your command!” retorted Hareton. “If you set store on him,",Wuthering Heights
768,you’d better be quiet.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will,Wuthering Heights
768,"never get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin,” she answered,",Wuthering Heights
768,sharply.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hearken, hearken, shoo’s cursing on ’em!” muttered Joseph, towards",Wuthering Heights
768,whom I had been steering.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern,",Wuthering Heights
768,"which I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it",Wuthering Heights
768,"back on the morrow, rushed to the nearest postern.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Maister, maister, he’s staling t’ lanthern!” shouted the ancient,",Wuthering Heights
768,"pursuing my retreat. “Hey, Gnasher! Hey, dog! Hey Wolf, holld him,",Wuthering Heights
768,holld him!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat,",Wuthering Heights
768,"bearing me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw",Wuthering Heights
768,from Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and,Wuthering Heights
768,"humiliation. Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching",Wuthering Heights
768,"their paws, and yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me",Wuthering Heights
768,"alive; but they would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie",Wuthering Heights
768,"till their malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and",Wuthering Heights
768,"trembling with wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out—on their",Wuthering Heights
768,peril to keep me one minute longer—with several incoherent threats of,Wuthering Heights
768,"retaliation that, in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of",Wuthering Heights
768,King Lear.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the,Wuthering Heights
768,"nose, and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded. I don’t know",Wuthering Heights
768,"what would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at",Wuthering Heights
768,"hand rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my",Wuthering Heights
768,"entertainer. This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued",Wuthering Heights
768,forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She thought that some,Wuthering Heights
768,"of them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack",Wuthering Heights
768,"her master, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger",Wuthering Heights
768,scoundrel.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, Mr. Earnshaw,” she cried, “I wonder what you’ll have agait next?",Wuthering Heights
768,Are we going to murder folk on our very door-stones? I see this house,Wuthering Heights
768,"will never do for me—look at t’ poor lad, he’s fair choking! Wisht,",Wuthering Heights
768,"wisht; you mun’n’t go on so. Come in, and I’ll cure that: there now,",Wuthering Heights
768,hold ye still.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my,Wuthering Heights
768,"neck, and pulled me into the kitchen. Mr. Heathcliff followed, his",Wuthering Heights
768,accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled",Wuthering Heights
768,perforce to accept lodgings under his roof. He told Zillah to give me a,Wuthering Heights
768,"glass of brandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she",Wuthering Heights
768,"condoled with me on my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders,",Wuthering Heights
768,"whereby I was somewhat revived, ushered me to bed.",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"While leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should hide the",Wuthering Heights
768,"candle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd notion about",Wuthering Heights
768,"the chamber she would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there",Wuthering Heights
768,"willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know, she answered: she had",Wuthering Heights
768,"only lived there a year or two; and they had so many queer goings on,",Wuthering Heights
768,she could not begin to be curious.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Too stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced",Wuthering Heights
768,"round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a",Wuthering Heights
768,"clothes-press, and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top",Wuthering Heights
768,"resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure, I looked",Wuthering Heights
768,"inside, and perceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch,",Wuthering Heights
768,very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of,Wuthering Heights
768,"the family having a room to himself. In fact, it formed a little",Wuthering Heights
768,"closet, and the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a",Wuthering Heights
768,table.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I slid back the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them",Wuthering Heights
768,"together again, and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff,",Wuthering Heights
768,and every one else.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up",Wuthering Heights
768,in one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.,Wuthering Heights
768,"This writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of",Wuthering Heights
768,"characters, large and small—_Catherine Earnshaw_, here and there varied",Wuthering Heights
768,"to _Catherine Heathcliff_, and then again to _Catherine Linton_.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued",Wuthering Heights
768,"spelling over Catherine Earnshaw—Heathcliff—Linton, till my eyes",Wuthering Heights
768,closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white,Wuthering Heights
768,"letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres—the air swarmed",Wuthering Heights
768,"with Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"discovered my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and",Wuthering Heights
768,perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under the influence of cold and",Wuthering Heights
768,"lingering nausea, sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee.",Wuthering Heights
768,"It was a Testament, in lean type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a",Wuthering Heights
768,"fly-leaf bore the inscription—“Catherine Earnshaw, her book,” and a",Wuthering Heights
768,date some quarter of a century back.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had examined all.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine’s library was select, and its state of dilapidation proved it",Wuthering Heights
768,"to have been well used, though not altogether for a legitimate purpose:",Wuthering Heights
768,scarcely one chapter had escaped a pen-and-ink commentary—at least the,Wuthering Heights
768,appearance of one—covering every morsel of blank that the printer had,Wuthering Heights
768,left. Some were detached sentences; other parts took the form of a,Wuthering Heights
768,"regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish hand. At the top of an",Wuthering Heights
768,"extra page (quite a treasure, probably, when first lighted on) I was",Wuthering Heights
768,greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend,Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph,—rudely, yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled",Wuthering Heights
768,"within me for the unknown Catherine, and I began forthwith to decipher",Wuthering Heights
768,her faded hieroglyphics.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“An awful Sunday,” commenced the paragraph beneath. “I wish my father",Wuthering Heights
768,were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute—his conduct to,Wuthering Heights

768,"anything but reading their Bibles, I’ll answer for it—Heathcliff,",Wuthering Heights
768,"myself, and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our",Wuthering Heights
768,"prayer-books, and mount: we were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn,",Wuthering Heights
768,"groaning and shivering, and hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so",Wuthering Heights
768,that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The,Wuthering Heights
768,service lasted precisely three hours; and yet my brother had the face,Wuthering Heights
768,"to exclaim, when he saw us descending, ‘What, done already?’ On Sunday",Wuthering Heights
768,"evenings we used to be permitted to play, if we did not make much",Wuthering Heights

768,"were, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour—foolish",Wuthering Heights

768,means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our,Wuthering Heights

768,I began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered from,Wuthering Heights
768,"manuscript to print. I saw a red ornamented title—“Seventy Times Seven,",Wuthering Heights
768,and the First of the Seventy-First. A Pious Discourse delivered by the,Wuthering Heights
768,"Reverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough.” And while",Wuthering Heights
768,"I was, half-consciously, worrying my brain to guess what Jabez",Wuthering Heights
768,"Branderham would make of his subject, I sank back in bed, and fell",Wuthering Heights
768,"asleep. Alas, for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! What else",Wuthering Heights
768,could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I don’t remember,Wuthering Heights
768,another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of,Wuthering Heights
768,suffering.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality.",Wuthering Heights
768,"I thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph",Wuthering Heights
768,"for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered",Wuthering Heights
768,"on, my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not",Wuthering Heights
768,brought a pilgrim’s staff: telling me that I could never get into the,Wuthering Heights
768,"house without one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel,",Wuthering Heights
768,which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it,Wuthering Heights
768,absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own,Wuthering Heights
768,residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there: we,Wuthering Heights
768,"were journeying to hear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the",Wuthering Heights
768,"text—“Seventy Times Seven;” and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had",Wuthering Heights
768,"committed the “First of the Seventy-First,” and were to be publicly",Wuthering Heights
768,exposed and excommunicated.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks, twice or",Wuthering Heights
768,"thrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow,",Wuthering Heights
768,"near a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes",Wuthering Heights
768,of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept,Wuthering Heights
768,whole hitherto; but as the clergyman’s stipend is only twenty pounds,Wuthering Heights
768,"per annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to",Wuthering Heights
768,"determine into one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor:",Wuthering Heights
768,especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let,Wuthering Heights
768,him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own,Wuthering Heights
768,"pockets. However, in my dream, Jabez had a full and attentive",Wuthering Heights
768,congregation; and he preached—good God! what a sermon; divided into,Wuthering Heights
768,"_four hundred and ninety_ parts, each fully equal to an ordinary",Wuthering Heights
768,"address from the pulpit, and each discussing a separate sin! Where he",Wuthering Heights
768,"searched for them, I cannot tell. He had his private manner of",Wuthering Heights
768,"interpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the brother should sin",Wuthering Heights
768,different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious,Wuthering Heights
768,character: odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Oh, how weary I grew. How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"revived! How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"stood up, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he",Wuthering Heights
768,"would _ever_ have done. I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he",Wuthering Heights
768,"reached the “_First of the Seventy-First_.” At that crisis, a sudden",Wuthering Heights
768,inspiration descended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez,Wuthering Heights
768,Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Sir,” I exclaimed, “sitting here within these four walls, at one",Wuthering Heights
768,"stretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads",Wuthering Heights
768,of your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat,Wuthering Heights
768,and been about to depart—Seventy times seven times have you,Wuthering Heights
768,preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and,Wuthering Heights
768,"ninety-first is too much. Fellow-martyrs, have at him! Drag him down,",Wuthering Heights

768,more!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“_Thou art the Man!_” cried Jabez, after a solemn pause, leaning over",Wuthering Heights
768,his cushion. “Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy,Wuthering Heights
768,"visage—seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul—Lo, this is",Wuthering Heights
768,human weakness: this also may be absolved! The First of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"Seventy-First is come. Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written.",Wuthering Heights
768,Such honour have all His saints!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in",Wuthering Heights
768,"self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most",Wuthering Heights
768,"ferocious assailant, for his. In the confluence of the multitude,",Wuthering Heights
768,"several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces.",Wuthering Heights
768,Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter,Wuthering Heights
768,"rappings: every man’s hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham,",Wuthering Heights
768,"unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud",Wuthering Heights
768,"taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at",Wuthering Heights
768,"last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me. And what was it that had",Wuthering Heights
768,suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabez’s part in the,Wuthering Heights
768,row? Merely the branch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the,Wuthering Heights
768,"blast wailed by, and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I",Wuthering Heights
768,"listened doubtingly an instant; detected the disturber, then turned and",Wuthering Heights
768,"dozed, and dreamt again: if possible, still more disagreeably than",Wuthering Heights
768,before.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard",Wuthering Heights
768,"distinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also,",Wuthering Heights
768,"the fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right",Wuthering Heights
768,"cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if",Wuthering Heights
768,"possible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the",Wuthering Heights
768,casement. The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance,Wuthering Heights
768,"observed by me when awake, but forgotten. “I must stop it,",Wuthering Heights
768,"nevertheless!” I muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and",Wuthering Heights
768,stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch; instead of,Wuthering Heights
768,"which, my fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The intense horror of nightmare came over me: I tried to draw back my,Wuthering Heights

768,“Let me in—let me in!”,Wuthering Heights

768,rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes:,Wuthering Heights

768,almost maddening me with fear.,Wuthering Heights

768,"Thereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile of books moved",Wuthering Heights
768,as if thrust forward.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I tried to jump up; but could not stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in",Wuthering Heights
768,a frenzy of fright.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"To my confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps",Wuthering Heights
768,"approached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous",Wuthering Heights
768,"hand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.",Wuthering Heights
768,"I sat shuddering, yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead:",Wuthering Heights
768,"the intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"At last, he said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer,",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Is any one here?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights

768,"With this intention, I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a",Wuthering Heights
768,"candle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall",Wuthering Heights
768,behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric,Wuthering Heights
768,"shock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"his agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is only your guest, sir,” I called out, desirous to spare him the",Wuthering Heights

768,disturbed you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood! I wish you were at the—” commenced",Wuthering Heights
768,"my host, setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible",Wuthering Heights
768,to hold it steady. “And who showed you up into this room?” he,Wuthering Heights
768,"continued, crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his teeth to",Wuthering Heights
768,subdue the maxillary convulsions. “Who was it? I’ve a good mind to turn,Wuthering Heights
768,them out of the house this moment!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It was your servant Zillah,” I replied, flinging myself on to the",Wuthering Heights

768,Mr. Heathcliff; she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to,Wuthering Heights
768,"get another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense. Well, it",Wuthering Heights
768,"is—swarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up,",Wuthering Heights
768,I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What do you mean?” asked Heathcliff, “and what are you doing? Lie down",Wuthering Heights
768,"and finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for Heaven’s sake!",Wuthering Heights
768,"don’t repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you",Wuthering Heights

768,Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of,Wuthering Heights

768,"slipped from my memory, till thus awakened. I blushed at my",Wuthering Heights
768,"inconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"offence, I hastened to add—“The truth is, sir, I passed the first part",Wuthering Heights
768,of the night in—” Here I stopped afresh—I was about to say “perusing,Wuthering Heights
768,"those old volumes,” then it would have revealed my knowledge of their",Wuthering Heights
768,"written, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I",Wuthering Heights
768,went on—“in spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge. A,Wuthering Heights
768,"monotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or—”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What _can_ you mean by talking in this way to _me!_” thundered,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff with savage vehemence. “How—how _dare_ you, under my",Wuthering Heights
768,roof?—God! he’s mad to speak so!” And he struck his forehead with rage.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my,Wuthering Heights
768,explanation; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and,Wuthering Heights
768,proceeded with my dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation,Wuthering Heights
768,"of “Catherine Linton” before, but reading it often over produced an",Wuthering Heights
768,impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination,Wuthering Heights
768,under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"bed, as I spoke; finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"guessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted breathing, that he",Wuthering Heights
768,struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show,Wuthering Heights
768,"him that I had heard the conflict, I continued my toilette rather",Wuthering Heights
768,"noisily, looked at my watch, and soliloquised on the length of the",Wuthering Heights
768,night: “Not three o’clock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six.,Wuthering Heights
768,Time stagnates here: we must surely have retired to rest at eight!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,” said my host, suppressing",Wuthering Heights
768,"a groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm’s shadow, dashing",Wuthering Heights
768,"a tear from his eyes. “Mr. Lockwood,” he added, “you may go into my",Wuthering Heights
768,"room: you’ll only be in the way, coming downstairs so early: and your",Wuthering Heights
768,childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And for me, too,” I replied. “I’ll walk in the yard till daylight, and",Wuthering Heights
768,then I’ll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.,Wuthering Heights
768,"I’m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or",Wuthering Heights
768,town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Delightful company!” muttered Heathcliff. “Take the candle, and go",Wuthering Heights
768,"where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard,",Wuthering Heights
768,"though, the dogs are unchained; and the house—Juno mounts sentinel",Wuthering Heights
768,"there, and—nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But,",Wuthering Heights
768,away with you! I’ll come in two minutes!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the",Wuthering Heights
768,"narrow lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a",Wuthering Heights
768,"piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly,",Wuthering Heights
768,"his apparent sense. He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the",Wuthering Heights
768,"lattice, bursting, as he pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion",Wuthering Heights
768,"of tears. “Come in! come in!” he sobbed. “Cathy, do come. Oh, do—_once_",Wuthering Heights
768,"more! Oh! my heart’s darling! hear me _this_ time, Catherine, at last!”",Wuthering Heights
768,The spectre showed a spectre’s ordinary caprice: it gave no sign of,Wuthering Heights

768,"station, and blowing out the light.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this,Wuthering Heights
768,"raving, that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off,",Wuthering Heights
768,"half angry to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my",Wuthering Heights
768,"ridiculous nightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was",Wuthering Heights
768,"beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and landed in the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly",Wuthering Heights
768,"together, enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except",Wuthering Heights
768,"a brindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a",Wuthering Heights
768,querulous mew.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the",Wuthering Heights
768,"hearth; on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the",Wuthering Heights
768,"other. We were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"then it was Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the",Wuthering Heights
768,"roof, through a trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose. He cast a",Wuthering Heights
768,sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between,Wuthering Heights
768,"the ribs, swept the cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in",Wuthering Heights
768,"the vacancy, commenced the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with",Wuthering Heights
768,tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of,Wuthering Heights
768,impudence too shameful for remark: he silently applied the tube to his,Wuthering Heights
768,"lips, folded his arms, and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury",Wuthering Heights
768,"unannoyed; and after sucking out his last wreath, and heaving a",Wuthering Heights
768,"profound sigh, he got up, and departed as solemnly as he came.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a,Wuthering Heights
768,"“good-morning,” but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orison _sotto voce_, in a series of",Wuthering Heights
768,"curses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a",Wuthering Heights
768,corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over,Wuthering Heights
768,"the back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of",Wuthering Heights
768,"exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed,",Wuthering Heights
768,"by his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard",Wuthering Heights
768,"couch, made a movement to follow him. He noticed this, and thrust at an",Wuthering Heights
768,"inner door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate",Wuthering Heights
768,"sound that there was the place where I must go, if I changed my",Wuthering Heights
768,locality.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"It opened into the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah",Wuthering Heights
768,urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the",Wuthering Heights
768,blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her,Wuthering Heights
768,"eyes, and seemed absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to",Wuthering Heights
768,"chide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog,",Wuthering Heights
768,"now and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was",Wuthering Heights
768,"surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire, his back",Wuthering Heights
768,"towards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever",Wuthering Heights
768,"and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron,",Wuthering Heights
768,and heave an indignant groan.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And you, you worthless—” he broke out as I entered, turning to his",Wuthering Heights
768,"daughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck, or",Wuthering Heights
768,"sheep, but generally represented by a dash—. “There you are, at your",Wuthering Heights
768,idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their bread—you live on my,Wuthering Heights

768,please!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance,",Wuthering Heights
768,obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be,Wuthering Heights
768,"entertained by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if",Wuthering Heights
768,"eager to partake the warmth of the hearth, and innocent of any",Wuthering Heights
768,knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to,Wuthering Heights
768,"suspend further hostilities: Heathcliff placed his fists, out of",Wuthering Heights
768,"temptation, in his pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked",Wuthering Heights
768,"to a seat far off, where she kept her word by playing the part of a",Wuthering Heights
768,statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined,Wuthering Heights
768,"joining their breakfast, and, at the first gleam of dawn, took an",Wuthering Heights
768,"opportunity of escaping into the free air, now clear, and still, and",Wuthering Heights
768,cold as impalpable ice.,Wuthering Heights

768,"ground: many pits, at least, were filled to a level; and entire ranges",Wuthering Heights
768,"of mounds, the refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart which my",Wuthering Heights
768,yesterday’s walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side,Wuthering Heights
768,"of the road, at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright",Wuthering Heights
768,"stones, continued through the whole length of the barren: these were",Wuthering Heights
768,"erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and also when a fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on",Wuthering Heights
768,"either hand with the firmer path: but, excepting a dirty dot pointing",Wuthering Heights
768,"up here and there, all traces of their existence had vanished: and my",Wuthering Heights
768,companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the,Wuthering Heights
768,"right or left, when I imagined I was following, correctly, the windings",Wuthering Heights
768,of the road.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"We exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the entrance of",Wuthering Heights
768,"Thrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error there. Our adieux were",Wuthering Heights
768,"limited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed forward, trusting to my own",Wuthering Heights
768,resources; for the porter’s lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance,Wuthering Heights
768,from the gate to the Grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make,Wuthering Heights
768,"it four, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the",Wuthering Heights
768,neck in snow: a predicament which only those who have experienced it,Wuthering Heights
768,"can appreciate. At any rate, whatever were my wanderings, the clock",Wuthering Heights
768,chimed twelve as I entered the house; and that gave exactly an hour for,Wuthering Heights
768,every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me; exclaiming,",Wuthering Heights
768,"tumultuously, they had completely given me up: everybody conjectured",Wuthering Heights
768,that I perished last night; and they were wondering how they must set,Wuthering Heights
768,"about the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet, now that they saw",Wuthering Heights
768,"me returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged upstairs;",Wuthering Heights
768,"whence, after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro thirty or",Wuthering Heights
768,"forty minutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned to my study,",Wuthering Heights
768,feeble as a kitten: almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and,Wuthering Heights
768,smoking coffee which the servant had prepared for my refreshment.,Wuthering Heights

768,"What vain weather-cocks we are! I, who had determined to hold myself",Wuthering Heights
768,"independent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at",Wuthering Heights
768,"length, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable—I,",Wuthering Heights
768,"weak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits",Wuthering Heights
768,"and solitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and under",Wuthering Heights
768,pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my,Wuthering Heights
768,"establishment, I desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit",Wuthering Heights
768,"down while I ate it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip,",Wuthering Heights
768,and either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You have lived here a considerable time,” I commenced; “did you not",Wuthering Heights
768,say sixteen years?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to wait on her;",Wuthering Heights
768,"after she died, the master retained me for his housekeeper.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Indeed.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"There ensued a pause. She was not a gossip, I feared; unless about her",Wuthering Heights
768,"own affairs, and those could hardly interest me. However, having",Wuthering Heights
768,"studied for an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of",Wuthering Heights
768,"meditation over her ruddy countenance, she ejaculated—“Ah, times are",Wuthering Heights
768,greatly changed since then!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes,” I remarked, “you’ve seen a good many alterations, I suppose?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I have: and troubles too,” she said.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, I’ll turn the talk on my landlord’s family!” I thought to myself.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“A good subject to start! And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to",Wuthering Heights
768,"know her history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is",Wuthering Heights
768,"more probable, an exotic that the surly _indigenae_ will not recognise",Wuthering Heights
768,for kin.” With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff let,Wuthering Heights
768,"Thrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a situation and residence",Wuthering Heights
768,so much inferior. “Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good,Wuthering Heights
768,order?” I inquired.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Rich, sir!” she returned. “He has nobody knows what money, and every",Wuthering Heights
768,"year it increases. Yes, yes, he’s rich enough to live in a finer house",Wuthering Heights
768,"than this: but he’s very near—close-handed; and, if he had meant to",Wuthering Heights
768,"flit to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good tenant he",Wuthering Heights
768,could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more.,Wuthering Heights
768,"It is strange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the",Wuthering Heights
768,world!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He had a son, it seems?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, he had one—he is dead.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Yes.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Where did she come from originally?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why, sir, she is my late master’s daughter: Catherine Linton was her",Wuthering Heights
768,"maiden name. I nursed her, poor thing! I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would",Wuthering Heights
768,"remove here, and then we might have been together again.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What! Catherine Linton?” I exclaimed, astonished. But a minute’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine. “Then,” I",Wuthering Heights
768,"continued, “my predecessor’s name was Linton?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“It was.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff? Are they relations?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“No; he is the late Mrs. Linton’s nephew.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“The young lady’s cousin, then?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the mother’s, the",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“I see the house at Wuthering Heights has ‘Earnshaw’ carved over the,Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is",Wuthering Heights
768,"of us—I mean, of the Lintons. Have you been to Wuthering Heights? I beg",Wuthering Heights
768,pardon for asking; but I should like to hear how she is!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mrs. Heathcliff? she looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"think, not very happy.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh dear, I don’t wonder! And how did you like the master?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean. Is not that his character?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone! The less you meddle with",Wuthering Heights
768,him the better.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl.,Wuthering Heights
768,Do you know anything of his history?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It’s a cuckoo’s, sir—I know all about it: except where he was born,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and who were his parents, and how he got his money at first. And",Wuthering Heights
768,Hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock! The unfortunate,Wuthering Heights
768,lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has,Wuthering Heights
768,been cheated.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of",Wuthering Heights
768,my neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good,Wuthering Heights
768,enough to sit and chat an hour.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, certainly, sir! I’ll just fetch a little sewing, and then I’ll sit",Wuthering Heights
768,"as long as you please. But you’ve caught cold: I saw you shivering, and",Wuthering Heights
768,you must have some gruel to drive it out.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my head",Wuthering Heights
768,"felt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, almost to",Wuthering Heights
768,"a pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain. This caused me to",Wuthering Heights
768,"feel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious",Wuthering Heights
768,effects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday. She returned,Wuthering Heights
768,"presently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having",Wuthering Heights
768,"placed the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to",Wuthering Heights
768,find me so companionable.,Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Before I came to live here, she commenced—waiting no farther invitation",Wuthering Heights
768,to her story—I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my,Wuthering Heights
768,"mother had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton’s father, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"I got used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped",Wuthering Heights
768,"to make hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody",Wuthering Heights
768,would set me to. One fine summer morning—it was the beginning of,Wuthering Heights
768,"harvest, I remember—Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came downstairs,",Wuthering Heights
768,"dressed for a journey; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be",Wuthering Heights
768,"done during the day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me—for I sat",Wuthering Heights
768,"eating my porridge with them—and he said, speaking to his son, “Now, my",Wuthering Heights
768,"bonny man, I’m going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you? You",Wuthering Heights
768,"may choose what you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there",Wuthering Heights
768,"and back: sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!” Hindley named a",Wuthering Heights
768,"fiddle, and then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but",Wuthering Heights
768,"she could ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip. He did",Wuthering Heights
768,"not forget me; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather severe",Wuthering Heights
768,"sometimes. He promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"then he kissed his children, said good-bye, and set off.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,It seemed a long while to us all—the three days of his absence—and,Wuthering Heights
768,often did little Cathy ask when he would be home. Mrs. Earnshaw,Wuthering Heights
768,"expected him by supper-time on the third evening, and she put the meal",Wuthering Heights
768,"off hour after hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and at",Wuthering Heights
768,last the children got tired of running down to the gate to look. Then,Wuthering Heights
768,"it grew dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to",Wuthering Heights
768,"be allowed to stay up; and, just about eleven o’clock, the door-latch",Wuthering Heights
768,"was raised quietly, and in stepped the master. He threw himself into a",Wuthering Heights
768,"chair, laughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was",Wuthering Heights
768,nearly killed—he would not have such another walk for the three,Wuthering Heights
768,kingdoms.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And at the end of it to be flighted to death!” he said, opening his",Wuthering Heights
768,"great-coat, which he held bundled up in his arms. “See here, wife! I",Wuthering Heights
768,was never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must e’en take it,Wuthering Heights
768,as a gift of God; though it’s as dark almost as if it came from the,Wuthering Heights
768,devil.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy’s head I had a peep at a dirty,",Wuthering Heights
768,"ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed,",Wuthering Heights
768,its face looked older than Catherine’s; yet when it was set on its,Wuthering Heights
768,"feet, it only stared round, and repeated over and over again some",Wuthering Heights
768,"gibberish that nobody could understand. I was frightened, and Mrs.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how",Wuthering Heights
768,"he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had",Wuthering Heights
768,"their own bairns to feed and fend for? What he meant to do with it, and",Wuthering Heights
768,whether he were mad? The master tried to explain the matter; but he was,Wuthering Heights
768,"really half dead with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst",Wuthering Heights
768,"her scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"as good as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and",Wuthering Heights
768,"inquired for its owner. Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and his money and time being both limited, he thought it better to take",Wuthering Heights
768,"it home with him at once, than run into vain expenses there: because he",Wuthering Heights
768,"was determined he would not leave it as he found it. Well, the",Wuthering Heights
768,"conclusion was, that my mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Earnshaw told me to wash it, and give it clean things, and let it sleep",Wuthering Heights
768,with the children.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till,Wuthering Heights
768,"peace was restored: then, both began searching their father’s pockets",Wuthering Heights
768,for the presents he had promised them. The former was a boy of,Wuthering Heights
768,"fourteen, but when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to",Wuthering Heights
768,"morsels in the great-coat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she",Wuthering Heights
768,"learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger,",Wuthering Heights
768,showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing;,Wuthering Heights
768,"earning for her pains a sound blow from her father, to teach her",Wuthering Heights
768,"cleaner manners. They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or",Wuthering Heights
768,"even in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing",Wuthering Heights
768,"of the stairs, hoping it might be gone on the morrow. By chance, or",Wuthering Heights
768,"else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw’s door,",Wuthering Heights
768,and there he found it on quitting his chamber. Inquiries were made as,Wuthering Heights
768,"to how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my",Wuthering Heights
768,cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,This was Heathcliff’s first introduction to the family. On coming back,Wuthering Heights
768,"a few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual),",Wuthering Heights
768,I found they had christened him “Heathcliff”: it was the name of a son,Wuthering Heights
768,"who died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for",Wuthering Heights
768,Christian and surname. Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but,Wuthering Heights
768,Hindley hated him: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued,Wuthering Heights
768,and went on with him shamefully: for I wasn’t reasonable enough to feel,Wuthering Heights
768,"my injustice, and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when",Wuthering Heights
768,she saw him wronged.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment:",Wuthering Heights
768,"he would stand Hindley’s blows without winking or shedding a tear, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if",Wuthering Heights
768,"he had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame. This",Wuthering Heights
768,"endurance made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son",Wuthering Heights
768,"persecuting the poor fatherless child, as he called him. He took to",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said",Wuthering Heights
768,"precious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above",Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at",Wuthering Heights
768,"Mrs. Earnshaw’s death, which happened in less than two years after, the",Wuthering Heights
768,young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather,Wuthering Heights
768,"than a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent’s affections",Wuthering Heights
768,and his privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these,Wuthering Heights
768,injuries. I sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"measles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at",Wuthering Heights
768,"once, I changed my idea. Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he",Wuthering Heights
768,lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose,Wuthering Heights
768,"he felt I did a good deal for him, and he hadn’t wit to guess that I",Wuthering Heights
768,"was compelled to do it. However, I will say this, he was the quietest",Wuthering Heights
768,child that ever nurse watched over. The difference between him and the,Wuthering Heights
768,others forced me to be less partial. Cathy and her brother harassed me,Wuthering Heights
768,"terribly: _he_ was as uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not",Wuthering Heights
768,"gentleness, made him give little trouble.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing",Wuthering Heights
768,"to me, and praised me for my care. I was vain of his commendations, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"softened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hindley lost his last ally: still I couldn’t dote on Heathcliff, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy;,Wuthering Heights
768,"who never, to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of",Wuthering Heights
768,"gratitude. He was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply",Wuthering Heights
768,"insensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and",Wuthering Heights
768,conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to,Wuthering Heights
768,"bend to his wishes. As an instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought",Wuthering Heights
768,"a couple of colts at the parish fair, and gave the lads each one.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff took the handsomest, but it soon fell lame, and when he",Wuthering Heights
768,"discovered it, he said to Hindley—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“You must exchange horses with me: I don’t like mine; and if you won’t,Wuthering Heights
768,I shall tell your father of the three thrashings you’ve given me this,Wuthering Heights
768,"week, and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.” Hindley put",Wuthering Heights
768,"out his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears. “You’d better do it at",Wuthering Heights
768,"once,” he persisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable):",Wuthering Heights
768,"“you will have to: and if I speak of these blows, you’ll get them again",Wuthering Heights
768,"with interest.” “Off, dog!” cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron",Wuthering Heights
768,"weight used for weighing potatoes and hay. “Throw it,” he replied,",Wuthering Heights
768,"standing still, “and then I’ll tell how you boasted that you would turn",Wuthering Heights
768,"me out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn",Wuthering Heights
768,"you out directly.” Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"down he fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"had not I prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who",Wuthering Heights
768,"had caused it. “Take my colt, Gipsy, then!” said young Earnshaw. “And I",Wuthering Heights
768,"pray that he may break your neck: take him, and be damned, you beggarly",Wuthering Heights
768,interloper! and wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards,Wuthering Heights
768,"show him what you are, imp of Satan.—And take that, I hope he’ll kick",Wuthering Heights
768,out your brains!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall;",Wuthering Heights
768,"he was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking",Wuthering Heights
768,"him under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes",Wuthering Heights
768,"were fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could. I was surprised to",Wuthering Heights
768,"witness how coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his",Wuthering Heights
768,"intention; exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a",Wuthering Heights
768,"bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned,",Wuthering Heights
768,before he entered the house. I persuaded him easily to let me lay the,Wuthering Heights
768,blame of his bruises on the horse: he minded little what tale was told,Wuthering Heights
768,"since he had what he wanted. He complained so seldom, indeed, of such",Wuthering Heights
768,"stirs as these, that I really thought him not vindictive: I was",Wuthering Heights
768,"deceived completely, as you will hear.",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,In the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail. He had been active,Wuthering Heights
768,"and healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was",Wuthering Heights
768,confined to the chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable. A nothing,Wuthering Heights
768,vexed him; and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into,Wuthering Heights
768,fits. This was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose,Wuthering Heights
768,"upon, or domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a",Wuthering Heights
768,word should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head,Wuthering Heights
768,"the notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to",Wuthering Heights
768,do him an ill-turn. It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder,Wuthering Heights
768,"among us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his",Wuthering Heights
768,partiality; and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child’s,Wuthering Heights
768,"pride and black tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice,",Wuthering Heights
768,"or thrice, Hindley’s manifestation of scorn, while his father was near,",Wuthering Heights
768,"roused the old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and",Wuthering Heights
768,shook with rage that he could not do it.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by",Wuthering Heights
768,"teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land",Wuthering Heights
768,himself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said—“Hindley was",Wuthering Heights
768,"nought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I hoped heartily we should have peace now. It hurt me to think the,Wuthering Heights
768,master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed. I fancied the,Wuthering Heights
768,discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as,Wuthering Heights
768,"he would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his",Wuthering Heights
768,"sinking frame. We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for",Wuthering Heights
768,"two people—Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay,",Wuthering Heights
768,"up yonder. He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest",Wuthering Heights
768,self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the,Wuthering Heights
768,promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours. By his,Wuthering Heights
768,"knack of sermonising and pious discoursing, he contrived to make a",Wuthering Heights
768,great impression on Mr. Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master,Wuthering Heights
768,"became, the more influence he gained. He was relentless in worrying him",Wuthering Heights
768,"about his soul’s concerns, and about ruling his children rigidly. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"encouraged him to regard Hindley as a reprobate; and, night after",Wuthering Heights
768,"night, he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff and Catherine: always minding to flatter Earnshaw’s weakness,Wuthering Heights
768,by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up,Wuthering Heights
768,before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener,Wuthering Heights
768,in a day: from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to,Wuthering Heights
768,"bed, we had not a minute’s security that she wouldn’t be in mischief.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Her spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always",Wuthering Heights
768,"going—singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the",Wuthering Heights
768,"same. A wild, wicked slip she was—but she had the bonniest eye, the",Wuthering Heights
768,"sweetest smile, and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I",Wuthering Heights
768,believe she meant no harm; for when once she made you cry in good,Wuthering Heights
768,"earnest, it seldom happened that she would not keep you company, and",Wuthering Heights
768,oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her. She was much too,Wuthering Heights
768,fond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could invent for her was,Wuthering Heights
768,to keep her separate from him: yet she got chided more than any of us,Wuthering Heights
768,"on his account. In play, she liked exceedingly to act the little",Wuthering Heights
768,"mistress; using her hands freely, and commanding her companions: she",Wuthering Heights
768,"did so to me, but I would not bear slapping and ordering; and so I let",Wuthering Heights
768,her know.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children: he had",Wuthering Heights
768,"always been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had",Wuthering Heights
768,no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing,Wuthering Heights
768,condition than he was in his prime. His peevish reproofs wakened in her,Wuthering Heights
768,a naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we,Wuthering Heights
768,"were all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy",Wuthering Heights
768,"look, and her ready words; turning Joseph’s religious curses into",Wuthering Heights
768,"ridicule, baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most—showing",Wuthering Heights
768,"how her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do _her_ bidding in,Wuthering Heights
768,"anything, and _his_ only when it suited his own inclination. After",Wuthering Heights
768,"behaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to",Wuthering Heights
768,"make it up at night. “Nay, Cathy,” the old man would say, “I cannot",Wuthering Heights
768,"love thee, thou’rt worse than thy brother. Go, say thy prayers, child,",Wuthering Heights
768,and ask God’s pardon. I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever,Wuthering Heights
768,"reared thee!” That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed",Wuthering Heights
768,"continually hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was",Wuthering Heights
768,"sorry for her faults, and beg to be forgiven.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw’s troubles on",Wuthering Heights
768,"earth. He died quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the",Wuthering Heights
768,"fire-side. A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the",Wuthering Heights
768,"chimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were",Wuthering Heights
768,"all together—I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting,",Wuthering Heights
768,and Joseph reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally,Wuthering Heights
768,"sat in the house then, after their work was done). Miss Cathy had been",Wuthering Heights
768,"sick, and that made her still; she leant against her father’s knee, and",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap. I remember,Wuthering Heights
768,"the master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair—it",Wuthering Heights
768,"pleased him rarely to see her gentle—and saying, “Why canst thou not",Wuthering Heights
768,"always be a good lass, Cathy?” And she turned her face up to his, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"laughed, and answered, “Why cannot you always be a good man, father?”",Wuthering Heights
768,"But as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said",Wuthering Heights
768,"she would sing him to sleep. She began singing very low, till his",Wuthering Heights
768,"fingers dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast. Then I told",Wuthering Heights
768,"her to hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake him. We all kept as",Wuthering Heights
768,"mute as mice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only",Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph, having finished his chapter, got up and said that he must rouse",Wuthering Heights
768,"the master for prayers and bed. He stepped forward, and called him by",Wuthering Heights
768,"name, and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took the",Wuthering Heights
768,candle and looked at him. I thought there was something wrong as he set,Wuthering Heights
768,"down the light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them",Wuthering Heights
768,"to “frame upstairs, and make little din—they might pray alone that",Wuthering Heights
768,evening—he had summut to do.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I shall bid father good-night first,” said Catherine, putting her arms",Wuthering Heights
768,"round his neck, before we could hinder her. The poor thing discovered",Wuthering Heights
768,"her loss directly—she screamed out—“Oh, he’s dead, Heathcliff! he’s",Wuthering Heights
768,dead!” And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we",Wuthering Heights
768,could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven. He,Wuthering Heights
768,told me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the,Wuthering Heights
768,"parson. I could not guess the use that either would be of, then.",Wuthering Heights
768,"However, I went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor,",Wuthering Heights
768,back with me; the other said he would come in the morning. Leaving,Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph to explain matters, I ran to the children’s room: their door was",Wuthering Heights
768,"ajar, I saw they had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but",Wuthering Heights
768,"they were calmer, and did not need me to console them. The little souls",Wuthering Heights
768,were comforting each other with better thoughts than I could have hit,Wuthering Heights
768,on: no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they,Wuthering Heights
768,"did, in their innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could",Wuthering Heights
768,not help wishing we were all there safe together.,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER VI,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and—a thing that amazed us, and",Wuthering Heights
768,set the neighbours gossiping right and left—he brought a wife with him.,Wuthering Heights
768,"What she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably,",Wuthering Heights
768,"she had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely",Wuthering Heights
768,have kept the union from his father.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own,Wuthering Heights
768,"account. Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold,",Wuthering Heights
768,appeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about,Wuthering Heights
768,"her: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"mourners. I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that",Wuthering Heights
768,"went on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I",Wuthering Heights
768,should have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and,Wuthering Heights
768,"clasping her hands, and asking repeatedly—“Are they gone yet?” Then she",Wuthering Heights
768,began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her,Wuthering Heights
768,"to see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell",Wuthering Heights
768,"a-weeping—and when I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn’t",Wuthering Heights
768,know; but she felt so afraid of dying! I imagined her as little likely,Wuthering Heights
768,"to die as myself. She was rather thin, but young, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"fresh-complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds. I did",Wuthering Heights
768,"remark, to be sure, that mounting the stairs made her breathe very",Wuthering Heights
768,"quick; that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver, and that",Wuthering Heights
768,she coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I knew nothing of what these,Wuthering Heights
768,"symptoms portended, and had no impulse to sympathise with her. We don’t",Wuthering Heights
768,"in general take to foreigners here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they take to",Wuthering Heights
768,us first.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his,Wuthering Heights
768,"absence. He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and",Wuthering Heights
768,"dressed quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told",Wuthering Heights
768,Joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the,Wuthering Heights
768,"back-kitchen, and leave the house for him. Indeed, he would have",Wuthering Heights
768,carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour; but his wife,Wuthering Heights
768,"expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace,",Wuthering Heights
768,"at the pewter dishes and delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space",Wuthering Heights
768,"there was to move about in where they usually sat, that he thought it",Wuthering Heights
768,"unnecessary to her comfort, and so dropped the intention.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new",Wuthering Heights
768,"acquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran",Wuthering Heights
768,"about with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Her affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hindley became tyrannical. A few words from her, evincing a dislike to",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy.",Wuthering Heights
768,"He drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"instructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of",Wuthering Heights
768,doors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the,Wuthering Heights
768,farm.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy",Wuthering Heights
768,"taught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the",Wuthering Heights
768,fields. They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the,Wuthering Heights
768,"young master being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they",Wuthering Heights
768,"did, so they kept clear of him. He would not even have seen after their",Wuthering Heights
768,"going to church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his",Wuthering Heights
768,carelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him to,Wuthering Heights
768,"order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or",Wuthering Heights
768,supper. But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the,Wuthering Heights
768,"moors in the morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment",Wuthering Heights
768,grew a mere thing to laugh at. The curate might set as many chapters as,Wuthering Heights
768,"he pleased for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff till his arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they,Wuthering Heights
768,were together again: at least the minute they had contrived some,Wuthering Heights
768,naughty plan of revenge; and many a time I’ve cried to myself to watch,Wuthering Heights
768,"them growing more reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable,",Wuthering Heights
768,for fear of losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended,Wuthering Heights
768,"creatures. One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from",Wuthering Heights
768,"the sitting-room, for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and when I went to call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere.",Wuthering Heights
768,"We searched the house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they",Wuthering Heights
768,"were invisible: and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the",Wuthering Heights
768,"doors, and swore nobody should let them in that night. The household",Wuthering Heights
768,"went to bed; and I, too anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put",Wuthering Heights
768,"my head out to hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in",Wuthering Heights
768,"spite of the prohibition, should they return. In a while, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"distinguished steps coming up the road, and the light of a lantern",Wuthering Heights
768,glimmered through the gate. I threw a shawl over my head and ran to,Wuthering Heights
768,prevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by knocking. There was,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a start to see him alone.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Where is Miss Catherine?” I cried hurriedly. “No accident, I hope?”",Wuthering Heights
768,"“At Thrushcross Grange,” he answered; “and I would have been there too,",Wuthering Heights
768,"but they had not the manners to ask me to stay.” “Well, you will catch",Wuthering Heights
768,it!” I said: “you’ll never be content till you’re sent about your,Wuthering Heights
768,business. What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?”,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Let me get off my wet clothes, and I’ll tell you all about it, Nelly,”",Wuthering Heights
768,"he replied. I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he",Wuthering Heights
768,"undressed and I waited to put out the candle, he continued—“Cathy and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"escaped from the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a",Wuthering Heights
768,"glimpse of the Grange lights, we thought we would just go and see",Wuthering Heights
768,whether the Lintons passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in,Wuthering Heights
768,"corners, while their father and mother sat eating and drinking, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"singing and laughing, and burning their eyes out before the fire. Do",Wuthering Heights
768,"you think they do? Or reading sermons, and being catechised by their",Wuthering Heights
768,"man-servant, and set to learn a column of Scripture names, if they",Wuthering Heights
768,"don’t answer properly?” “Probably not,” I responded. “They are good",Wuthering Heights
768,"children, no doubt, and don’t deserve the treatment you receive, for",Wuthering Heights
768,"your bad conduct.” “Don’t cant, Nelly,” he said: “nonsense! We ran from",Wuthering Heights
768,"the top of the Heights to the park, without stopping—Catherine",Wuthering Heights
768,"completely beaten in the race, because she was barefoot. You’ll have to",Wuthering Heights
768,seek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow. We crept through a broken,Wuthering Heights
768,"hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves on a",Wuthering Heights
768,flower-plot under the drawing-room window. The light came from thence;,Wuthering Heights
768,"they had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were only half",Wuthering Heights
768,"closed. Both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and clinging to the ledge, and we saw—ah! it was beautiful—a splendid",Wuthering Heights
768,"place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass-drops hanging",Wuthering Heights
768,"in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with little soft",Wuthering Heights
768,tapers. Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar and his sister,Wuthering Heights
768,had it entirely to themselves. Shouldn’t they have been happy? We,Wuthering Heights
768,"should have thought ourselves in heaven! And now, guess what your good",Wuthering Heights
768,"children were doing? Isabella—I believe she is eleven, a year younger",Wuthering Heights
768,"than Cathy—lay screaming at the farther end of the room, shrieking as",Wuthering Heights
768,if witches were running red-hot needles into her. Edgar stood on the,Wuthering Heights
768,"hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat a little",Wuthering Heights
768,"dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual accusations,",Wuthering Heights
768,we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them. The idiots!,Wuthering Heights
768,That was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm,Wuthering Heights
768,"hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to get it,",Wuthering Heights
768,refused to take it. We laughed outright at the petted things; we did,Wuthering Heights
768,despise them! When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine,Wuthering Heights
768,"wanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? I’d not",Wuthering Heights
768,"exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton’s",Wuthering Heights
768,at Thrushcross Grange—not if I might have the privilege of flinging,Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with",Wuthering Heights
768,Hindley’s blood!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hush, hush!” I interrupted. “Still you have not told me, Heathcliff,",Wuthering Heights
768,how Catherine is left behind?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I told you we laughed,” he answered. “The Lintons heard us, and with",Wuthering Heights
768,"one accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"then a cry, ‘Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come here. Oh,",Wuthering Heights
768,"papa, oh!’ They really did howl out something in that way. We made",Wuthering Heights
768,"frightful noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off",Wuthering Heights
768,"the ledge, because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had",Wuthering Heights
768,"better flee. I had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all",Wuthering Heights
768,"at once she fell down. ‘Run, Heathcliff, run!’ she whispered. ‘They",Wuthering Heights
768,"have let the bull-dog loose, and he holds me!’ The devil had seized her",Wuthering Heights
768,"ankle, Nelly: I heard his abominable snorting. She did not yell out—no!",Wuthering Heights
768,"she would have scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns",Wuthering Heights
768,"of a mad cow. I did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate",Wuthering Heights
768,any fiend in Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his,Wuthering Heights
768,"jaws, and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat. A beast",Wuthering Heights
768,"of a servant came up with a lantern, at last, shouting—‘Keep fast,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Skulker, keep fast!’ He changed his note, however, when he saw",Wuthering Heights
768,"Skulker’s game. The dog was throttled off; his huge, purple tongue",Wuthering Heights
768,"hanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips streaming",Wuthering Heights
768,"with bloody slaver. The man took Cathy up; she was sick: not from fear,",Wuthering Heights
768,"I’m certain, but from pain. He carried her in; I followed, grumbling",Wuthering Heights
768,"execrations and vengeance. ‘What prey, Robert?’ hallooed Linton from",Wuthering Heights
768,"the entrance. ‘Skulker has caught a little girl, sir,’ he replied; ‘and",Wuthering Heights
768,"there’s a lad here,’ he added, making a clutch at me, ‘who looks an",Wuthering Heights
768,out-and-outer! Very like the robbers were for putting them through the,Wuthering Heights
768,"window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep, that they",Wuthering Heights
768,"might murder us at their ease. Hold your tongue, you foul-mouthed",Wuthering Heights
768,"thief, you! you shall go to the gallows for this. Mr. Linton, sir,",Wuthering Heights
768,"don’t lay by your gun.’ ‘No, no, Robert,’ said the old fool. ‘The",Wuthering Heights
768,rascals knew that yesterday was my rent-day: they thought to have me,Wuthering Heights
768,"cleverly. Come in; I’ll furnish them a reception. There, John, fasten",Wuthering Heights
768,"the chain. Give Skulker some water, Jenny. To beard a magistrate in his",Wuthering Heights
768,"stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too! Where will their insolence stop?",Wuthering Heights
768,"Oh, my dear Mary, look here! Don’t be afraid, it is but a boy—yet the",Wuthering Heights
768,villain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not be a kindness to,Wuthering Heights
768,"the country to hang him at once, before he shows his nature in acts as",Wuthering Heights
768,"well as features?’ He pulled me under the chandelier, and Mrs. Linton",Wuthering Heights
768,placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror. The,Wuthering Heights
768,"cowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella lisping—‘Frightful thing!",Wuthering Heights
768,"Put him in the cellar, papa. He’s exactly like the son of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant. Isn’t he, Edgar?’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and laughed. Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected",Wuthering Heights
768,"sufficient wit to recognise her. They see us at church, you know,",Wuthering Heights
768,though we seldom meet them elsewhere. ‘That’s Miss Earnshaw!’ he,Wuthering Heights
768,"whispered to his mother, ‘and look how Skulker has bitten her—how her",Wuthering Heights
768,foot bleeds!’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“‘Miss Earnshaw? Nonsense!’ cried the dame; ‘Miss Earnshaw scouring the,Wuthering Heights
768,"country with a gipsy! And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning—surely",Wuthering Heights
768,it is—and she may be lamed for life!’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘What culpable carelessness in her brother!’ exclaimed Mr. Linton,",Wuthering Heights
768,turning from me to Catherine. ‘I’ve understood from Shielders’” (that,Wuthering Heights
768,"was the curate, sir) “‘that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism.",Wuthering Heights
768,But who is this? Where did she pick up this companion? Oho! I declare,Wuthering Heights
768,"he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey",Wuthering Heights
768,"to Liverpool—a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway.’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘A wicked boy, at all events,’ remarked the old lady, ‘and quite unfit",Wuthering Heights
768,"for a decent house! Did you notice his language, Linton? I’m shocked",Wuthering Heights
768,that my children should have heard it.’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I recommenced cursing—don’t be angry, Nelly—and so Robert was ordered",Wuthering Heights
768,to take me off. I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the,Wuthering Heights
768,"garden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw",Wuthering Heights
768,"should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly,",Wuthering Heights
768,secured the door again. The curtains were still looped up at one,Wuthering Heights
768,"corner, and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had",Wuthering Heights
768,"wished to return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a",Wuthering Heights
768,"million of fragments, unless they let her out. She sat on the sofa",Wuthering Heights
768,quietly. Mrs. Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we,Wuthering Heights
768,"had borrowed for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with",Wuthering Heights
768,"her, I suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction",Wuthering Heights
768,between her treatment and mine. Then the woman-servant brought a basin,Wuthering Heights
768,"of warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of",Wuthering Heights
768,"negus, and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar",Wuthering Heights
768,"stood gaping at a distance. Afterwards, they dried and combed her",Wuthering Heights
768,"beautiful hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled",Wuthering Heights
768,"her to the fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her",Wuthering Heights
768,"food between the little dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he",Wuthering Heights
768,ate; and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the,Wuthering Heights
768,Lintons—a dim reflection from her own enchanting face. I saw they were,Wuthering Heights
768,full of stupid admiration; she is so immeasurably superior to them—to,Wuthering Heights
768,"everybody on earth, is she not, Nelly?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There will more come of this business than you reckon on,” I answered,",Wuthering Heights
768,"covering him up and extinguishing the light. “You are incurable,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if",Wuthering Heights
768,he won’t.” My words came truer than I desired. The luckless adventure,Wuthering Heights
768,"made Earnshaw furious. And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a",Wuthering Heights
768,"visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture",Wuthering Heights
768,"on the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about",Wuthering Heights
768,"him, in earnest. Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that",Wuthering Heights
768,the first word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal;,Wuthering Heights
768,and Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint,Wuthering Heights
768,"when she returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would",Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER VII,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas. By that,Wuthering Heights
768,"time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved. The",Wuthering Heights
768,"mistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of",Wuthering Heights
768,reform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and,Wuthering Heights
768,"flattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless",Wuthering Heights
768,"little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all",Wuthering Heights
768,"breathless, there lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified",Wuthering Heights
768,"person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered",Wuthering Heights
768,"beaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with",Wuthering Heights
768,"both hands that she might sail in. Hindley lifted her from her horse,",Wuthering Heights
768,"exclaiming delightedly, “Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty! I should",Wuthering Heights
768,scarcely have known you: you look like a lady now. Isabella Linton is,Wuthering Heights
768,"not to be compared with her, is she, Frances?” “Isabella has not her",Wuthering Heights
768,"natural advantages,” replied his wife: “but she must mind and not grow",Wuthering Heights
768,"wild again here. Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things—Stay,",Wuthering Heights
768,"dear, you will disarrange your curls—let me untie your hat.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk",Wuthering Heights
768,"frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes",Wuthering Heights
768,"sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she",Wuthering Heights
768,dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid,Wuthering Heights
768,garments. She kissed me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas,Wuthering Heights
768,"cake, and it would not have done to give me a hug; and then she looked",Wuthering Heights
768,round for Heathcliff. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their,Wuthering Heights
768,"meeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what",Wuthering Heights
768,grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first. If he were careless, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"uncared for, before Catherine’s absence, he had been ten times more so",Wuthering Heights
768,"since. Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom",Wuthering Heights
768,"have a natural pleasure in soap and water. Therefore, not to mention",Wuthering Heights
768,"his clothes, which had seen three months’ service in mire and dust, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"his thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally",Wuthering Heights
768,"beclouded. He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a",Wuthering Heights
768,"bright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed",Wuthering Heights
768,"counterpart of himself, as he expected. “Is Heathcliff not here?” she",Wuthering Heights
768,"demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully",Wuthering Heights
768,whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Heathcliff, you may come forward,” cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his",Wuthering Heights
768,"discomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard",Wuthering Heights
768,he would be compelled to present himself. “You may come and wish Miss,Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine welcome, like the other servants.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to",Wuthering Heights
768,embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the,Wuthering Heights
768,"second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh,",Wuthering Heights
768,"exclaiming, “Why, how very black and cross you look! and how—how funny",Wuthering Heights
768,and grim! But that’s because I’m used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw",Wuthering Heights
768,"double gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Shake hands, Heathcliff,” said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; “once in",Wuthering Heights
768,"a way, that is permitted.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I shall not,” replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; “I shall",Wuthering Heights
768,not stand to be laughed at. I shall not bear it!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"And he would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him",Wuthering Heights
768,again.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I did not mean to laugh at you,” she said; “I could not hinder myself:",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, shake hands at least! What are you sulky for? It was only",Wuthering Heights
768,"that you looked odd. If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will",Wuthering Heights
768,be all right: but you are so dirty!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and",Wuthering Heights
768,also at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from,Wuthering Heights
768,its contact with his.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You needn’t have touched me!” he answered, following her eye and",Wuthering Heights
768,snatching away his hand. “I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like,Wuthering Heights
768,"to be dirty, and I will be dirty.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of",Wuthering Heights
768,"the master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine;",Wuthering Heights
768,who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an,Wuthering Heights
768,exhibition of bad temper.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"After playing lady’s-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the",Wuthering Heights
768,"oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires,",Wuthering Heights
768,"befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by",Wuthering Heights
768,"singing carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph’s affirmations that he",Wuthering Heights
768,considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs. He had,Wuthering Heights
768,"retired to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw",Wuthering Heights
768,were engaging Missy’s attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to,Wuthering Heights
768,"present to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness.",Wuthering Heights
768,"They had invited them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the",Wuthering Heights
768,"invitation had been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that",Wuthering Heights
768,her darlings might be kept carefully apart from that “naughty swearing,Wuthering Heights
768,boy.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Under these circumstances I remained solitary. I smelt the rich scent,Wuthering Heights
768,"of the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the",Wuthering Heights
768,"polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready",Wuthering Heights
768,"to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless",Wuthering Heights
768,purity of my particular care—the scoured and well-swept floor. I gave,Wuthering Heights
768,"due inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old",Wuthering Heights
768,"Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass,",Wuthering Heights
768,and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I,Wuthering Heights
768,"went on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he",Wuthering Heights
768,should suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally,Wuthering Heights
768,"led me to consider the poor lad’s situation now, and from singing I",Wuthering Heights
768,"changed my mind to crying. It struck me soon, however, there would be",Wuthering Heights
768,more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding,Wuthering Heights
768,tears over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek him. He was,Wuthering Heights
768,not far; I found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the,Wuthering Heights
768,"stable, and feeding the other beasts, according to custom.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Make haste, Heathcliff!” I said, “the kitchen is so comfortable; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph is upstairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss",Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth",Wuthering Heights
768,"to yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Come—are you coming?” I continued. “There’s a little cake for each of,Wuthering Heights
768,"you, nearly enough; and you’ll need half-an-hour’s donning.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him. Catherine supped",Wuthering Heights
768,with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an,Wuthering Heights
768,"unsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on",Wuthering Heights
768,the other. His cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the,Wuthering Heights
768,"fairies. He managed to continue work till nine o’clock, and then",Wuthering Heights
768,"marched dumb and dour to his chamber. Cathy sat up late, having a world",Wuthering Heights
768,of things to order for the reception of her new friends: she came into,Wuthering Heights
768,"the kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only",Wuthering Heights
768,"stayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went back. In the",Wuthering Heights
768,"morning he rose early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour",Wuthering Heights
768,on to the moors; not re-appearing till the family were departed for,Wuthering Heights
768,church. Fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better,Wuthering Heights
768,"spirit. He hung about me for a while, and having screwed up his",Wuthering Heights
768,"courage, exclaimed abruptly—“Nelly, make me decent, I’m going to be",Wuthering Heights
768,good.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“High time, Heathcliff,” I said; “you _have_ grieved Catherine: she’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"sorry she ever came home, I daresay! It looks as if you envied her,",Wuthering Heights
768,because she is more thought of than you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the",Wuthering Heights
768,notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Did she say she was grieved?” he inquired, looking very serious.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, _I_ cried last night,” he returned, “and I had more reason to",Wuthering Heights
768,cry than she.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an,Wuthering Heights
768,"empty stomach,” said I. “Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.",Wuthering Heights
768,"But, if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind,",Wuthering Heights
768,"when she comes in. You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say—you",Wuthering Heights
768,"know best what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought",Wuthering Heights
768,"her converted into a stranger by her grand dress. And now, though I",Wuthering Heights
768,"have dinner to get ready, I’ll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar",Wuthering Heights
768,Linton shall look quite a doll beside you: and that he does. You are,Wuthering Heights
768,"younger, and yet, I’ll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad",Wuthering Heights
768,across the shoulders; you could knock him down in a twinkling; don’t,Wuthering Heights
768,you feel that you could?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff’s face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and",Wuthering Heights
768,he sighed.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn’t make him",Wuthering Heights
768,"less handsome or me more so. I wish I had light hair and a fair skin,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich",Wuthering Heights
768,as he will be!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And cried for mamma at every turn,” I added, “and trembled if a",Wuthering Heights
768,"country lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a",Wuthering Heights
768,"shower of rain. Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit! Come to",Wuthering Heights
768,"the glass, and I’ll let you see what you should wish. Do you mark those",Wuthering Heights
768,"two lines between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of",Wuthering Heights
768,"rising arched, sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so",Wuthering Heights
768,"deeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting",Wuthering Heights
768,"under them, like devil’s spies? Wish and learn to smooth away the surly",Wuthering Heights
768,"wrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to",Wuthering Heights
768,"confident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always",Wuthering Heights
768,seeing friends where they are not sure of foes. Don’t get the,Wuthering Heights
768,expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are,Wuthering Heights
768,"its desert, and yet hates all the world, as well as the kicker, for",Wuthering Heights
768,what it suffers.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton’s great blue eyes and",Wuthering Heights
768,"even forehead,” he replied. “I do—and that won’t help me to them.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,” I continued, “if",Wuthering Heights
768,you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into,Wuthering Heights
768,"something worse than ugly. And now that we’ve done washing, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"combing, and sulking—tell me whether you don’t think yourself rather",Wuthering Heights
768,"handsome? I’ll tell you, I do. You’re fit for a prince in disguise. Who",Wuthering Heights
768,"knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian",Wuthering Heights
768,"queen, each of them able to buy up, with one week’s income, Wuthering",Wuthering Heights
768,Heights and Thrushcross Grange together? And you were kidnapped by,Wuthering Heights
768,"wicked sailors and brought to England. Were I in your place, I would",Wuthering Heights
768,frame high notions of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should,Wuthering Heights
768,give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little,Wuthering Heights
768,farmer!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to,Wuthering Heights
768,"look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted",Wuthering Heights
768,by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court. He ran,Wuthering Heights
768,"to the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons",Wuthering Heights
768,"descend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the",Wuthering Heights
768,Earnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in,Wuthering Heights
768,"winter. Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them",Wuthering Heights
768,"into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour",Wuthering Heights
768,into their white faces.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he",Wuthering Heights
768,"willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the",Wuthering Heights
768,"door leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the",Wuthering Heights
768,"other. They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and",Wuthering Heights
768,"cheerful, or, perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved",Wuthering Heights
768,"him back with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph “keep the fellow",Wuthering Heights
768,out of the room—send him into the garret till dinner is over. He’ll be,Wuthering Heights
768,"cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone",Wuthering Heights
768,with them a minute.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nay, sir,” I could not avoid answering, “he’ll touch nothing, not he:",Wuthering Heights
768,and I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till",Wuthering Heights
768,"dark,” cried Hindley. “Begone, you vagabond! What! you are attempting",Wuthering Heights
768,"the coxcomb, are you? Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks—see",Wuthering Heights
768,if I won’t pull them a bit longer!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“They are long enough already,” observed Master Linton, peeping from",Wuthering Heights
768,the doorway; “I wonder they don’t make his head ache. It’s like a,Wuthering Heights
768,colt’s mane over his eyes!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but,Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff’s violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance,Wuthering Heights
768,"of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.",Wuthering Heights
768,"He seized a tureen of hot apple sauce, the first thing that came under",Wuthering Heights
768,"his gripe, and dashed it full against the speaker’s face and neck; who",Wuthering Heights
768,instantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine,Wuthering Heights
768,hurrying to the place. Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly,Wuthering Heights
768,"and conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a",Wuthering Heights
768,"rough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he appeared red and",Wuthering Heights
768,"breathless. I got the dish-cloth, and rather spitefully scrubbed",Wuthering Heights
768,"Edgar’s nose and mouth, affirming it served him right for meddling. His",Wuthering Heights
768,"sister began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded,",Wuthering Heights
768,blushing for all.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“You should not have spoken to him!” she expostulated with Master,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton. “He was in a bad temper, and now you’ve spoilt your visit; and",Wuthering Heights
768,he’ll be flogged: I hate him to be flogged! I can’t eat my dinner. Why,Wuthering Heights
768,"did you speak to him, Edgar?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I didn’t,” sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the",Wuthering Heights
768,remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief. “I,Wuthering Heights
768,"promised mamma that I wouldn’t say one word to him, and I didn’t.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, don’t cry,” replied Catherine, contemptuously; “you’re not",Wuthering Heights
768,"killed. Don’t make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet! Hush,",Wuthering Heights
768,Isabella! Has anybody hurt _you?_”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There, there, children—to your seats!” cried Hindley, bustling in.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely. Next time, Master Edgar,",Wuthering Heights
768,take the law into your own fists—it will give you an appetite!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant,Wuthering Heights
768,"feast. They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no",Wuthering Heights
768,"real harm had befallen them. Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls,",Wuthering Heights
768,and the mistress made them merry with lively talk. I waited behind her,Wuthering Heights
768,"chair, and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an",Wuthering Heights
768,"indifferent air, commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“An unfeeling child,” I thought to myself; “how lightly she dismisses",Wuthering Heights
768,her old playmate’s troubles. I could not have imagined her to be so,Wuthering Heights
768,selfish.” She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down,Wuthering Heights
768,"again: her cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over them. She slipped",Wuthering Heights
768,"her fork to the floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her",Wuthering Heights
768,emotion. I did not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in,Wuthering Heights
768,"purgatory throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of",Wuthering Heights
768,"getting by herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been",Wuthering Heights
768,"locked up by the master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce",Wuthering Heights
768,to him a private mess of victuals.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,In the evening we had a dance. Cathy begged that he might be liberated,Wuthering Heights
768,"then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and",Wuthering Heights
768,I was appointed to supply the deficiency. We got rid of all gloom in,Wuthering Heights
768,"the excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the",Wuthering Heights
768,"arrival of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a",Wuthering Heights
768,"trombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides",Wuthering Heights
768,"singers. They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive",Wuthering Heights
768,"contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to",Wuthering Heights
768,"hear them. After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs",Wuthering Heights
768,"and glees. Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of,Wuthering Heights
768,"the steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed. They shut the house",Wuthering Heights
768,"door below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people. She",Wuthering Heights
768,"made no stay at the stairs’-head, but mounted farther, to the garret",Wuthering Heights
768,"where Heathcliff was confined, and called him. He stubbornly declined",Wuthering Heights
768,"answering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to",Wuthering Heights
768,hold communion with her through the boards. I let the poor things,Wuthering Heights
768,"converse unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and",Wuthering Heights
768,the singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to,Wuthering Heights
768,"warn her. Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within. The",Wuthering Heights
768,"little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof,",Wuthering Heights
768,"into the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I",Wuthering Heights
768,"could coax her out again. When she did come, Heathcliff came with her,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and she insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my",Wuthering Heights
768,"fellow-servant had gone to a neighbour’s, to be removed from the sound",Wuthering Heights
768,"of our “devil’s psalmody,” as it pleased him to call it. I told them I",Wuthering Heights
768,intended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had,Wuthering Heights
768,"never broken his fast since yesterday’s dinner, I would wink at his",Wuthering Heights
768,cheating Mr. Hindley that once. He went down: I set him a stool by the,Wuthering Heights
768,"fire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and",Wuthering Heights
768,"could eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"leant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands, and",Wuthering Heights
768,remained rapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject of his,Wuthering Heights
768,"thoughts, he answered gravely—“I’m trying to settle how I shall pay",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hindley back. I don’t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at",Wuthering Heights
768,last. I hope he will not die before I do!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“For shame, Heathcliff!” said I. “It is for God to punish wicked",Wuthering Heights
768,people; we should learn to forgive.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, God won’t have the satisfaction that I shall,” he returned. “I",Wuthering Heights
768,"only wish I knew the best way! Let me alone, and I’ll plan it out:",Wuthering Heights
768,while I’m thinking of that I don’t feel pain.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you. I’m annoyed",Wuthering Heights
768,how I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel,Wuthering Heights
768,"cold, and you nodding for bed! I could have told Heathcliff’s history,",Wuthering Heights

768,"was very far from nodding. “Sit still, Mrs. Dean,” I cried; “do sit",Wuthering Heights
768,still another half-hour. You’ve done just right to tell the story,Wuthering Heights
768,leisurely. That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the,Wuthering Heights
768,"same style. I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more",Wuthering Heights
768,or less.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“No matter—I’m not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours. One or,Wuthering Heights
768,two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“You shouldn’t lie till ten. There’s the very prime of the morning gone,Wuthering Heights
768,long before that time. A person who has not done one-half his day’s,Wuthering Heights
768,"work by ten o’clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend",Wuthering Heights
768,lengthening the night till afternoon. I prognosticate for myself an,Wuthering Heights
768,"obstinate cold, at least.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me to leap over some three",Wuthering Heights
768,years; during that space Mrs. Earnshaw—”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, no, I’ll allow nothing of the sort! Are you acquainted with the",Wuthering Heights
768,"mood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking",Wuthering Heights
768,"its kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so",Wuthering Heights
768,intently that puss’s neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of,Wuthering Heights
768,temper?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“A terribly lazy mood, I should say.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“On the contrary, a tiresomely active one. It is mine, at present; and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"therefore, continue minutely. I perceive that people in these regions",Wuthering Heights
768,acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does,Wuthering Heights
768,"over a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the",Wuthering Heights
768,deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"looker-on. They _do_ live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less",Wuthering Heights
768,"in surface, change, and frivolous external things. I could fancy a love",Wuthering Heights
768,for life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love,Wuthering Heights
768,of a year’s standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to,Wuthering Heights
768,"a single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do",Wuthering Heights
768,"it justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French",Wuthering Heights
768,cooks: he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but,Wuthering Heights
768,each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us,”",Wuthering Heights
768,"observed Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Excuse me,” I responded; “you, my good friend, are a striking evidence",Wuthering Heights
768,against that assertion. Excepting a few provincialisms of slight,Wuthering Heights
768,"consequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to",Wuthering Heights
768,consider as peculiar to your class. I am sure you have thought a great,Wuthering Heights
768,deal more than the generality of servants think. You have been,Wuthering Heights
768,compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions,Wuthering Heights
768,for frittering your life away in silly trifles.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Mrs. Dean laughed.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,” she",Wuthering Heights
768,said; “not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of,Wuthering Heights
768,"faces, and one series of actions, from year’s end to year’s end; but I",Wuthering Heights
768,"have undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then,",Wuthering Heights
768,"I have read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood. You could not open",Wuthering Heights
768,"a book in this library that I have not looked into, and got something",Wuthering Heights
768,"out of also: unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and that of",Wuthering Heights
768,French; and those I know one from another: it is as much as you can,Wuthering Heights
768,"expect of a poor man’s daughter. However, if I am to follow my story in",Wuthering Heights
768,"true gossip’s fashion, I had better go on; and instead of leaping three",Wuthering Heights
768,"years, I will be content to pass to the next summer—the summer of 1778,",Wuthering Heights
768,that is nearly twenty-three years ago.”,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER VIII,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"On the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"the last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born. We were busy with the",Wuthering Heights
768,"hay in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our",Wuthering Heights
768,breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the,Wuthering Heights
768,"lane, calling me as she ran.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, such a grand bairn!” she panted out. “The finest lad that ever",Wuthering Heights
768,breathed! But the doctor says missis must go: he says she’s been in a,Wuthering Heights
768,consumption these many months. I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now,Wuthering Heights
768,"she has nothing to keep her, and she’ll be dead before winter. You must",Wuthering Heights
768,"come home directly. You’re to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar",Wuthering Heights
768,"and milk, and take care of it day and night. I wish I were you, because",Wuthering Heights
768,it will be all yours when there is no missis!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But is she very ill?” I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my",Wuthering Heights
768,bonnet.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,” replied the girl, “and she",Wuthering Heights
768,talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man. She’s out of,Wuthering Heights
768,"her head for joy, it’s such a beauty! If I were her I’m certain I",Wuthering Heights
768,"should not die: I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite",Wuthering Heights
768,of Kenneth. I was fairly mad at him. Dame Archer brought the cherub,Wuthering Heights
768,"down to master, in the house, and his face just began to light up, when",Wuthering Heights
768,"the old croaker steps forward, and says he—‘Earnshaw, it’s a blessing",Wuthering Heights
768,"your wife has been spared to leave you this son. When she came, I felt",Wuthering Heights
768,"convinced we shouldn’t keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the",Wuthering Heights
768,"winter will probably finish her. Don’t take on, and fret about it too",Wuthering Heights
768,"much: it can’t be helped. And besides, you should have known better",Wuthering Heights
768,than to choose such a rush of a lass!’”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And what did the master answer?” I inquired.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I think he swore: but I didn’t mind him, I was straining to see the",Wuthering Heights
768,"bairn,” and she began again to describe it rapturously. I, as zealous",Wuthering Heights
768,"as herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was",Wuthering Heights
768,very sad for Hindley’s sake. He had room in his heart only for two,Wuthering Heights
768,"idols—his wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,couldn’t conceive how he would bear the loss.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and, as I passed in, I asked, “how was the baby?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nearly ready to run about, Nell!” he replied, putting on a cheerful",Wuthering Heights
768,smile.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And the mistress?” I ventured to inquire; “the doctor says she’s—”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Damn the doctor!” he interrupted, reddening. “Frances is quite right:",Wuthering Heights
768,she’ll be perfectly well by this time next week. Are you going,Wuthering Heights
768,"upstairs? will you tell her that I’ll come, if she’ll promise not to",Wuthering Heights
768,talk. I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she,Wuthering Heights
768,must—tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty,Wuthering Heights
768,"spirits, and replied merrily, “I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there",Wuthering Heights
768,"he has gone out twice, crying. Well, say I promise I won’t speak: but",Wuthering Heights
768,that does not bind me not to laugh at him!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Poor soul! Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed,Wuthering Heights
768,"her; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming",Wuthering Heights
768,her health improved every day. When Kenneth warned him that his,Wuthering Heights
768,"medicines were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn’t put",Wuthering Heights
768,"him to further expense by attending her, he retorted, “I know you need",Wuthering Heights
768,not—she’s well—she does not want any more attendance from you! She,Wuthering Heights
768,never was in a consumption. It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse,Wuthering Heights
768,"is as slow as mine now, and her cheek as cool.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one",Wuthering Heights
768,"night, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought",Wuthering Heights
768,"she should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her—a",Wuthering Heights
768,very slight one—he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about,Wuthering Heights
768,"his neck, her face changed, and she was dead.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my",Wuthering Heights
768,"hands. Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him",Wuthering Heights
768,"cry, was contented, as far as regarded him. For himself, he grew",Wuthering Heights
768,desperate: his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament. He neither,Wuthering Heights
768,"wept nor prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave",Wuthering Heights
768,himself up to reckless dissipation. The servants could not bear his,Wuthering Heights
768,tyrannical and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that,Wuthering Heights
768,"would stay. I had not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you",Wuthering Heights
768,"know, I had been his foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more",Wuthering Heights
768,readily than a stranger would. Joseph remained to hector over tenants,Wuthering Heights
768,and labourers; and because it was his vocation to be where he had,Wuthering Heights
768,plenty of wickedness to reprove.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The master’s bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine and Heathcliff. His treatment of the latter was enough to,Wuthering Heights
768,"make a fiend of a saint. And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_",Wuthering Heights
768,possessed of something diabolical at that period. He delighted to,Wuthering Heights
768,witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily,Wuthering Heights
768,more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity. I could not half tell,Wuthering Heights
768,"what an infernal house we had. The curate dropped calling, and nobody",Wuthering Heights
768,"decent came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton’s visits to Miss",Wuthering Heights
768,Cathy might be an exception. At fifteen she was the queen of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"country-side; she had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty,",Wuthering Heights
768,"headstrong creature! I own I did not like her, after infancy was past;",Wuthering Heights
768,and I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she,Wuthering Heights
768,"never took an aversion to me, though. She had a wondrous constancy to",Wuthering Heights
768,old attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections,Wuthering Heights
768,"unalterably; and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it",Wuthering Heights
768,difficult to make an equally deep impression. He was my late master:,Wuthering Heights
768,"that is his portrait over the fireplace. It used to hang on one side,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and his wife’s on the other; but hers has been removed, or else you",Wuthering Heights
768,might see something of what she was. Can you make that out?,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face,",Wuthering Heights
768,"exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive",Wuthering Heights
768,and amiable in expression. It formed a sweet picture. The long light,Wuthering Heights
768,hair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious;,Wuthering Heights
768,the figure almost too graceful. I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw,Wuthering Heights
768,could forget her first friend for such an individual. I marvelled much,Wuthering Heights
768,"how he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea",Wuthering Heights
768,of Catherine Earnshaw.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“A very agreeable portrait,” I observed to the house-keeper. “Is it",Wuthering Heights
768,like?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes,” she answered; “but he looked better when he was animated; that",Wuthering Heights
768,is his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her,Wuthering Heights
768,five-weeks’ residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show,Wuthering Heights
768,"her rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of",Wuthering Heights
768,"being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed",Wuthering Heights
768,unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality;,Wuthering Heights
768,"gained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her",Wuthering Heights
768,brother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first—for she was,Wuthering Heights
768,full of ambition—and led her to adopt a double character without,Wuthering Heights
768,exactly intending to deceive any one. In the place where she heard,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff termed a “vulgar young ruffian,” and “worse than a brute,”",Wuthering Heights
768,she took care not to act like him; but at home she had small,Wuthering Heights
768,"inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and",Wuthering Heights
768,restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor,Wuthering Heights
768,praise.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly. He,Wuthering Heights
768,"had a terror of Earnshaw’s reputation, and shrunk from encountering",Wuthering Heights
768,him; and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility:,Wuthering Heights
768,"the master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if",Wuthering Heights
768,"he could not be gracious, kept out of the way. I rather think his",Wuthering Heights
768,"appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful,",Wuthering Heights
768,"never played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two",Wuthering Heights
768,friends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton in his presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his",Wuthering Heights
768,"absence; and when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff,",Wuthering Heights
768,"she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference, as if",Wuthering Heights
768,depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.,Wuthering Heights
768,"I’ve had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles, which",Wuthering Heights
768,she vainly strove to hide from my mockery. That sounds ill-natured: but,Wuthering Heights
768,"she was so proud, it became really impossible to pity her distresses,",Wuthering Heights
768,"till she should be chastened into more humility. She did bring herself,",Wuthering Heights
768,"finally, to confess, and to confide in me: there was not a soul else",Wuthering Heights
768,that she might fashion into an adviser.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed",Wuthering Heights
768,to give himself a holiday on the strength of it. He had reached the age,Wuthering Heights
768,"of sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being",Wuthering Heights
768,"deficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward",Wuthering Heights
768,and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.,Wuthering Heights
768,"In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early",Wuthering Heights
768,"education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had",Wuthering Heights
768,"extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge,",Wuthering Heights
768,and any love for books or learning. His childhood’s sense of,Wuthering Heights
768,"superiority, instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was",Wuthering Heights
768,faded away. He struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in,Wuthering Heights
768,"her studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he",Wuthering Heights
768,yielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step,Wuthering Heights
768,"in the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink",Wuthering Heights
768,beneath his former level. Then personal appearance sympathised with,Wuthering Heights
768,mental deterioration: he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look;,Wuthering Heights
768,his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost,Wuthering Heights
768,"idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure,",Wuthering Heights
768,"apparently, in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few",Wuthering Heights
768,acquaintance.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of,Wuthering Heights
768,respite from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her,Wuthering Heights
768,"in words, and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses,",Wuthering Heights
768,as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks,Wuthering Heights
768,of affection on him. On the before-named occasion he came into the,Wuthering Heights
768,"house to announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting",Wuthering Heights
768,Miss Cathy to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it,Wuthering Heights
768,into his head to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place,Wuthering Heights
768,"to herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her",Wuthering Heights
768,"brother’s absence, and was then preparing to receive him.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?” asked Heathcliff. “Are you going",Wuthering Heights
768,anywhere?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, it is raining,” she answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why have you that silk frock on, then?” he said. “Nobody coming here,",Wuthering Heights
768,I hope?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Not that I know of,” stammered Miss: “but you should be in the field",Wuthering Heights
768,"now, Heathcliff. It is an hour past dinner time; I thought you were",Wuthering Heights
768,gone.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,” observed",Wuthering Heights
768,the boy. “I’ll not work any more to-day: I’ll stay with you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, but Joseph will tell,” she suggested; “you’d better go!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will,Wuthering Heights
768,"take him till dark, and he’ll never know.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"So saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down. Catherine reflected",Wuthering Heights
768,"an instant, with knitted brows—she found it needful to smooth the way",Wuthering Heights
768,for an intrusion. “Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this,Wuthering Heights
768,"afternoon,” she said, at the conclusion of a minute’s silence. “As it",Wuthering Heights
768,"rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run",Wuthering Heights
768,the risk of being scolded for no good.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,” he persisted; “don’t turn",Wuthering Heights
768,"me out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours! I’m on the point,",Wuthering Heights
768,"sometimes, of complaining that they—but I’ll not—”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“That they what?” cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled",Wuthering Heights
768,"countenance. “Oh, Nelly!” she added petulantly, jerking her head away",Wuthering Heights
768,"from my hands, “you’ve combed my hair quite out of curl! That’s enough;",Wuthering Heights
768,"let me alone. What are you on the point of complaining about,",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Nothing—only look at the almanack on that wall;” he pointed to a,Wuthering Heights
768,"framed sheet hanging near the window, and continued, “The crosses are",Wuthering Heights
768,"for the evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those",Wuthering Heights
768,spent with me. Do you see? I’ve marked every day.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes—very foolish: as if I took notice!” replied Catherine, in a",Wuthering Heights
768,peevish tone. “And where is the sense of that?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“To show that I _do_ take notice,” said Heathcliff.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And should I always be sitting with you?” she demanded, growing more",Wuthering Heights
768,irritated. “What good do I get? What do you talk about? You might be,Wuthering Heights
768,"dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you",Wuthering Heights
768,"do, either!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you",Wuthering Heights
768,"disliked my company, Cathy!” exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It’s no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,” she",Wuthering Heights
768,muttered.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Her companion rose up, but he hadn’t time to express his feelings",Wuthering Heights
768,"further, for a horse’s feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked",Wuthering Heights
768,"gently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the",Wuthering Heights
768,unexpected summons he had received. Doubtless Catherine marked the,Wuthering Heights
768,"difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out.",Wuthering Heights
768,"The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal",Wuthering Heights
768,country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were,Wuthering Heights
768,"as opposite as his aspect. He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"pronounced his words as you do: that’s less gruff than we talk here,",Wuthering Heights
768,and softer.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m not come too soon, am I?” he said, casting a look at me: I had",Wuthering Heights
768,"begun to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the",Wuthering Heights
768,dresser.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” answered Catherine. “What are you doing there, Nelly?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“My work, Miss,” I replied. (Mr. Hindley had given me directions to",Wuthering Heights
768,make a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.),Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She stepped behind me and whispered crossly, “Take yourself and your",Wuthering Heights
768,"dusters off; when company are in the house, servants don’t commence",Wuthering Heights
768,scouring and cleaning in the room where they are!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It’s a good opportunity, now that master is away,” I answered aloud:",Wuthering Heights
768,“he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence. I’m,Wuthering Heights
768,sure Mr. Edgar will excuse me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ presence,” exclaimed the young lady",Wuthering Heights
768,"imperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to",Wuthering Heights
768,recover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m sorry for it, Miss Catherine,” was my response; and I proceeded",Wuthering Heights
768,assiduously with my occupation.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my",Wuthering Heights
768,"hand, and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the",Wuthering Heights
768,"arm. I’ve said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her",Wuthering Heights
768,"vanity now and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up",Wuthering Heights
768,"from my knees, and screamed out, “Oh, Miss, that’s a nasty trick! You",Wuthering Heights
768,"have no right to nip me, and I’m not going to bear it.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I didn’t touch you, you lying creature!” cried she, her fingers",Wuthering Heights
768,"tingling to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage. She never had",Wuthering Heights
768,"power to conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a",Wuthering Heights
768,blaze.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What’s that, then?” I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to",Wuthering Heights
768,refute her.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled",Wuthering Heights
768,"by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging",Wuthering Heights
768,blow that filled both eyes with water.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Catherine, love! Catherine!” interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the",Wuthering Heights
768,double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Leave the room, Ellen!” she repeated, trembling all over.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on",Wuthering Heights
768,"the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out",Wuthering Heights
768,"complaints against “wicked aunt Cathy,” which drew her fury on to his",Wuthering Heights
768,"unlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor",Wuthering Heights
768,"child waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to",Wuthering Heights
768,"deliver him. In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young",Wuthering Heights
768,man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be,Wuthering Heights
768,mistaken for jest. He drew back in consternation. I lifted Hareton in,Wuthering Heights
768,"my arms, and walked off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of",Wuthering Heights
768,"communication open, for I was curious to watch how they would settle",Wuthering Heights
768,their disagreement. The insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had,Wuthering Heights
768,"laid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“That’s right!” I said to myself. “Take warning and begone! It’s a,Wuthering Heights
768,kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Where are you going?” demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He swerved aside, and attempted to pass.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You must not go!” she exclaimed, energetically.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“I must and shall!” he replied in a subdued voice.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” she persisted, grasping the handle; “not yet, Edgar Linton: sit",Wuthering Heights
768,down; you shall not leave me in that temper. I should be miserable all,Wuthering Heights
768,"night, and I won’t be miserable for you!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Can I stay after you have struck me?” asked Linton.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine was mute.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’ve made me afraid and ashamed of you,” he continued; “I’ll not",Wuthering Heights
768,come here again!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And you told a deliberate untruth!” he said.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I didn’t!” she cried, recovering her speech; “I did nothing",Wuthering Heights
768,"deliberately. Well, go, if you please—get away! And now I’ll cry—I’ll",Wuthering Heights
768,cry myself sick!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious",Wuthering Heights
768,earnest. Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there,Wuthering Heights
768,he lingered. I resolved to encourage him.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,” I called out. “As bad as any marred",Wuthering Heights
768,"child: you’d better be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to",Wuthering Heights
768,grieve us.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed the,Wuthering Heights
768,power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse,Wuthering Heights
768,"half killed, or a bird half eaten. Ah, I thought, there will be no",Wuthering Heights
768,"saving him: he’s doomed, and flies to his fate! And so it was: he",Wuthering Heights
768,"turned abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind",Wuthering Heights
768,him; and when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had,Wuthering Heights
768,"come home rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears",Wuthering Heights
768,"(his ordinary frame of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had",Wuthering Heights
768,merely effected a closer intimacy—had broken the outworks of youthful,Wuthering Heights
768,"timidity, and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and",Wuthering Heights
768,confess themselves lovers.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Intelligence of Mr. Hindley’s arrival drove Linton speedily to his,Wuthering Heights
768,"horse, and Catherine to her chamber. I went to hide little Hareton, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"to take the shot out of the master’s fowling-piece, which he was fond",Wuthering Heights
768,"of playing with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of",Wuthering Heights
768,"any who provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit",Wuthering Heights
768,"upon the plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did",Wuthering Heights
768,go the length of firing the gun.,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER IX,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the",Wuthering Heights
768,act of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard. Hareton was,Wuthering Heights
768,impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild,Wuthering Heights
768,beast’s fondness or his madman’s rage; for in one he ran a chance of,Wuthering Heights
768,"being squeezed and kissed to death, and in the other of being flung",Wuthering Heights
768,"into the fire, or dashed against the wall; and the poor thing remained",Wuthering Heights
768,perfectly quiet wherever I chose to put him.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There, I’ve found it out at last!” cried Hindley, pulling me back by",Wuthering Heights
768,"the skin of my neck, like a dog. “By heaven and hell, you’ve sworn",Wuthering Heights
768,"between you to murder that child! I know how it is, now, that he is",Wuthering Heights
768,"always out of my way. But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you",Wuthering Heights
768,"swallow the carving-knife, Nelly! You needn’t laugh; for I’ve just",Wuthering Heights
768,"crammed Kenneth, head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is",Wuthering Heights
768,the same as one—and I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest,Wuthering Heights
768,till I do!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But I don’t like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,” I answered; “it has",Wuthering Heights
768,"been cutting red herrings. I’d rather be shot, if you please.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“You’d rather be damned!” he said; “and so you shall. No law in England,Wuthering Heights
768,"can hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine’s abominable!",Wuthering Heights
768,Open your mouth.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point between my teeth:",Wuthering Heights
768,"but, for my part, I was never much afraid of his vagaries. I spat out,",Wuthering Heights
768,and affirmed it tasted detestably—I would not take it on any account.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh!” said he, releasing me, “I see that hideous little villain is not",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton: I beg your pardon, Nell. If it be, he deserves flaying alive",Wuthering Heights
768,"for not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Unnatural cub, come hither! I’ll teach thee to impose on a",Wuthering Heights
768,"good-hearted, deluded father. Now, don’t you think the lad would be",Wuthering Heights
768,"handsomer cropped? It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something",Wuthering Heights
768,"fierce—get me a scissors—something fierce and trim! Besides, it’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"infernal affectation—devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears—we’re",Wuthering Heights
768,"asses enough without them. Hush, child, hush! Well then, it is my",Wuthering Heights
768,"darling! wisht, dry thy eyes—there’s a joy; kiss me. What! it won’t?",Wuthering Heights
768,"Kiss me, Hareton! Damn thee, kiss me! By God, as if I would rear such a",Wuthering Heights
768,"monster! As sure as I’m living, I’ll break the brat’s neck.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father’s arms with all,Wuthering Heights
768,"his might, and redoubled his yells when he carried him upstairs and",Wuthering Heights
768,lifted him over the banister. I cried out that he would frighten the,Wuthering Heights
768,"child into fits, and ran to rescue him. As I reached them, Hindley",Wuthering Heights
768,leant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below; almost,Wuthering Heights
768,"forgetting what he had in his hands. “Who is that?” he asked, hearing",Wuthering Heights
768,"some one approaching the stairs’-foot. I leant forward also, for the",Wuthering Heights
768,"purpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come",Wuthering Heights
768,"further; and, at the instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a",Wuthering Heights
768,"sudden spring, delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him,",Wuthering Heights
768,and fell.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw,Wuthering Heights
768,that the little wretch was safe. Heathcliff arrived underneath just at,Wuthering Heights
768,"the critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"setting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the",Wuthering Heights
768,accident. A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five,Wuthering Heights
768,"shillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand",Wuthering Heights
768,"pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding",Wuthering Heights
768,"the figure of Mr. Earnshaw above. It expressed, plainer than words",Wuthering Heights
768,"could do, the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument",Wuthering Heights
768,"of thwarting his own revenge. Had it been dark, I daresay he would have",Wuthering Heights
768,tried to remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton’s skull on the steps;,Wuthering Heights
768,"but, we witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my",Wuthering Heights
768,"precious charge pressed to my heart. Hindley descended more leisurely,",Wuthering Heights
768,sobered and abashed.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is your fault, Ellen,” he said; “you should have kept him out of",Wuthering Heights
768,sight: you should have taken him from me! Is he injured anywhere?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Injured!” I cried angrily; “if he is not killed, he’ll be an idiot!",Wuthering Heights
768,Oh! I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use,Wuthering Heights
768,him. You’re worse than a heathen—treating your own flesh and blood in,Wuthering Heights
768,that manner!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with me,",Wuthering Heights
768,sobbed off his terror directly. At the first finger his father laid on,Wuthering Heights
768,"him, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as if",Wuthering Heights
768,he would go into convulsions.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“You shall not meddle with him!” I continued. “He hates you—they all,Wuthering Heights
768,hate you—that’s the truth! A happy family you have; and a pretty state,Wuthering Heights
768,you’re come to!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,” laughed the misguided man,",Wuthering Heights
768,"recovering his hardness. “At present, convey yourself and him away. And",Wuthering Heights
768,"hark you, Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"wouldn’t murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire:",Wuthering Heights
768,but that’s as my fancy goes.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and",Wuthering Heights
768,poured some into a tumbler.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nay, don’t!” I entreated. “Mr. Hindley, do take warning. Have mercy on",Wuthering Heights
768,"this unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Any one will do better for him than I shall,” he answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Have mercy on your own soul!” I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass",Wuthering Heights
768,from his hand.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Not I! On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to",Wuthering Heights
768,"perdition to punish its Maker,” exclaimed the blasphemer. “Here’s to",Wuthering Heights
768,its hearty damnation!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his,Wuthering Heights
768,command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or,Wuthering Heights
768,remember.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It’s a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,” observed Heathcliff,",Wuthering Heights
768,muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut. “He’s doing,Wuthering Heights
768,his very utmost; but his constitution defies him. Mr. Kenneth says he,Wuthering Heights
768,"would wager his mare that he’ll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton,",Wuthering Heights
768,and go to the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the,Wuthering Heights
768,common course befall him.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn. It turned out",Wuthering Heights
768,"afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when",Wuthering Heights
768,"he flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire, and",Wuthering Heights
768,remained silent.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began,—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,",Wuthering Heights
768,"The mither beneath the mools heard that,",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her",Wuthering Heights
768,"head in, and whispered,—“Are you alone, Nelly?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, Miss,” I replied.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She entered and approached the hearth. I, supposing she was going to",Wuthering Heights
768,"say something, looked up. The expression of her face seemed disturbed",Wuthering Heights
768,"and anxious. Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and",Wuthering Heights
768,she drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence. I,Wuthering Heights
768,resumed my song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Where’s Heathcliff?” she said, interrupting me.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“About his work in the stable,” was my answer.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze. There,Wuthering Heights
768,"followed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two",Wuthering Heights
768,trickle from Catherine’s cheek to the flags. Is she sorry for her,Wuthering Heights
768,shameful conduct?—I asked myself. That will be a novelty: but she may,Wuthering Heights
768,"come to the point as she will—I sha’n’t help her! No, she felt small",Wuthering Heights
768,"trouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, dear!” she cried at last. “I’m very unhappy!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“A pity,” observed I. “You’re hard to please; so many friends and so",Wuthering Heights
768,"few cares, and can’t make yourself content!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?” she pursued, kneeling down by",Wuthering Heights
768,"me, and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look",Wuthering Heights
768,"which turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the",Wuthering Heights
768,world to indulge it.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is it worth keeping?” I inquired, less sulkily.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out! I want to know what I",Wuthering Heights
768,"should do. To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I’ve",Wuthering Heights
768,"given him an answer. Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or",Wuthering Heights
768,"denial, you tell me which it ought to have been.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?” I replied. “To be sure,",Wuthering Heights
768,considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this,Wuthering Heights
768,"afternoon, I might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked",Wuthering Heights
768,"you after that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome",Wuthering Heights
768,fool.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“If you talk so, I won’t tell you any more,” she returned, peevishly",Wuthering Heights
768,"rising to her feet. “I accepted him, Nelly. Be quick, and say whether I",Wuthering Heights
768,was wrong!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“You accepted him! Then what good is it discussing the matter? You have,Wuthering Heights
768,"pledged your word, and cannot retract.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“But say whether I should have done so—do!” she exclaimed in an,Wuthering Heights
768,"irritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“There are many things to be considered before that question can be,Wuthering Heights
768,"answered properly,” I said, sententiously. “First and foremost, do you",Wuthering Heights
768,love Mr. Edgar?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Who can help it? Of course I do,” she answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of,Wuthering Heights
768,twenty-two it was not injudicious.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nonsense, I do—that’s sufficient.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“By no means; you must say why?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Bad!” was my commentary.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And because he is young and cheerful.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Bad, still.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And because he loves me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Indifferent, coming there.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Worst of all. And now, say how you love him?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“As everybody loves—You’re silly, Nelly.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Not at all—Answer.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"everything he touches, and every word he says. I love all his looks,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and all his actions, and him entirely and altogether. There now!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And why?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured! It’s,Wuthering Heights
768,"no jest to me!” said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to",Wuthering Heights
768,the fire.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,” I replied. “You love Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Edgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"loves you. The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him",Wuthering Heights
768,"without that, probably; and with it you wouldn’t, unless he possessed",Wuthering Heights
768,the four former attractions.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, to be sure not: I should only pity him—hate him, perhaps, if he",Wuthering Heights
768,"were ugly, and a clown.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world:",Wuthering Heights
768,"handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is. What should hinder you from",Wuthering Heights
768,loving them?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“If there be any, they are out of my way: I’ve seen none like Edgar.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You may see some; and he won’t always be handsome, and young, and may",Wuthering Heights
768,not always be rich.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“He is now; and I have only to do with the present. I wish you would,Wuthering Heights
768,speak rationally.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry",Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Linton.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“I don’t want your permission for that—I _shall_ marry him: and yet you,Wuthering Heights
768,have not told me whether I’m right.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present. And,Wuthering Heights
768,"now, let us hear what you are unhappy about. Your brother will be",Wuthering Heights
768,"pleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will",Wuthering Heights
768,"escape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable",Wuthering Heights
768,"one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. All seems smooth and",Wuthering Heights
768,easy: where is the obstacle?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“_Here_! and _here_!” replied Catherine, striking one hand on her",Wuthering Heights
768,"forehead, and the other on her breast: “in whichever place the soul",Wuthering Heights
768,"lives. In my soul and in my heart, I’m convinced I’m wrong!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“That’s very strange! I cannot make it out.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It’s my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I’ll explain it: I",Wuthering Heights
768,can’t do it distinctly; but I’ll give you a feeling of how I feel.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver,",Wuthering Heights
768,and her clasped hands trembled.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?” she said, suddenly, after",Wuthering Heights
768,some minutes’ reflection.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, now and then,” I answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And so do I. I’ve dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me,Wuthering Heights
768,"ever after, and changed my ideas: they’ve gone through and through me,",Wuthering Heights
768,"like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind. And this is",Wuthering Heights
768,one: I’m going to tell it—but take care not to smile at any part of,Wuthering Heights
768,it.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh! don’t, Miss Catherine!” I cried. “We’re dismal enough without",Wuthering Heights
768,"conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us. Come, come, be merry and",Wuthering Heights
768,like yourself! Look at little Hareton! _he’s_ dreaming nothing dreary.,Wuthering Heights
768,How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude! You remember,Wuthering Heights
768,"him, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing:",Wuthering Heights
768,"nearly as young and innocent. However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to",Wuthering Heights
768,listen: it’s not long; and I’ve no power to be merry to-night.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I won’t hear it, I won’t hear it!” I repeated, hastily.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had",Wuthering Heights
768,"an unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which",Wuthering Heights
768,"I might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe. She was",Wuthering Heights
768,"vexed, but she did not proceed. Apparently taking up another subject,",Wuthering Heights
768,she recommenced in a short time.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Because you are not fit to go there,” I answered. “All sinners would",Wuthering Heights
768,be miserable in heaven.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“But it is not for that. I dreamt once that I was there.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I tell you I won’t hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine! I’ll go to",Wuthering Heights
768,"bed,” I interrupted again.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“This is nothing,” cried she: “I was only going to say that heaven did",Wuthering Heights
768,not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back,Wuthering Heights
768,to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the,Wuthering Heights
768,middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke,Wuthering Heights
768,"sobbing for joy. That will do to explain my secret, as well as the",Wuthering Heights
768,other. I’ve no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in,Wuthering Heights
768,heaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so,Wuthering Heights
768,"low, I shouldn’t have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not",Wuthering Heights
768,"because he’s handsome, Nelly, but because he’s more myself than I am.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff’s presence.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Having noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise",Wuthering Heights
768,"from the bench, and steal out noiselessly. He had listened till he",Wuthering Heights
768,"heard Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he",Wuthering Heights
768,"stayed to hear no further. My companion, sitting on the ground, was",Wuthering Heights
768,prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or,Wuthering Heights
768,"departure; but I started, and bade her hush!",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why?” she asked, gazing nervously round.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Joseph is here,” I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his",Wuthering Heights
768,cartwheels up the road; “and Heathcliff will come in with him. I’m not,Wuthering Heights
768,sure whether he were not at the door this moment.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, he couldn’t overhear me at the door!” said she. “Give me Hareton,",Wuthering Heights
768,"while you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you.",Wuthering Heights
768,"I want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff has no notion of these things. He has not, has he? He does",Wuthering Heights
768,not know what being in love is!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,” I returned;",Wuthering Heights
768,"“and if _you_ are his choice, he’ll be the most unfortunate creature",Wuthering Heights
768,"that ever was born! As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and love, and all! Have you considered how you’ll bear the separation,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and how he’ll bear to be quite deserted in the world? Because, Miss",Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine—”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He quite deserted! we separated!” she exclaimed, with an accent of",Wuthering Heights
768,"indignation. “Who is to separate us, pray? They’ll meet the fate of",Wuthering Heights
768,"Milo! Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature. Every",Wuthering Heights
768,Linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could,Wuthering Heights
768,"consent to forsake Heathcliff. Oh, that’s not what I intend—that’s not",Wuthering Heights
768,what I mean! I shouldn’t be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!,Wuthering Heights
768,He’ll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime. Edgar must,Wuthering Heights
768,"shake off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least. He will, when he",Wuthering Heights
768,"learns my true feelings towards him. Nelly, I see now you think me a",Wuthering Heights
768,selfish wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I,Wuthering Heights
768,"married, we should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother’s power.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“With your husband’s money, Miss Catherine?” I asked. “You’ll find him",Wuthering Heights
768,"not so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I’m hardly a judge, I",Wuthering Heights
768,think that’s the worst motive you’ve given yet for being the wife of,Wuthering Heights
768,young Linton.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is not,” retorted she; “it is the best! The others were the",Wuthering Heights
768,"satisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar’s sake, too, to satisfy him.",Wuthering Heights
768,This is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings,Wuthering Heights
768,to Edgar and myself. I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody,Wuthering Heights
768,have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond,Wuthering Heights
768,"you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained",Wuthering Heights
768,"here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff’s miseries,",Wuthering Heights
768,and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in,Wuthering Heights
768,"living is himself. If all else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should",Wuthering Heights
768,"still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were",Wuthering Heights
768,"annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not",Wuthering Heights
768,seem a part of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods:,Wuthering Heights
768,"time will change it, I’m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My",Wuthering Heights
768,love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of,Wuthering Heights
768,"little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff! He’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always",Wuthering Heights
768,"a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don’t talk of our",Wuthering Heights
768,separation again: it is impracticable; and—”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it",Wuthering Heights
768,forcibly away. I was out of patience with her folly!,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,” I said, “it only goes",Wuthering Heights
768,to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in,Wuthering Heights
768,"marrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl. But trouble",Wuthering Heights
768,me with no more secrets: I’ll not promise to keep them.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’ll keep that?” she asked, eagerly.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, I’ll not promise,” I repeated.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our",Wuthering Heights
768,"conversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton, while I made the supper. After it was cooked, my",Wuthering Heights
768,fellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,Hindley; and we didn’t settle it till all was nearly cold. Then we came,Wuthering Heights
768,"to the agreement that we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we",Wuthering Heights
768,feared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time,Wuthering Heights
768,alone.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And how isn’t that nowt comed in fro’ th’ field, be this time? What is",Wuthering Heights
768,"he about? girt idle seeght!” demanded the old man, looking round for",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ll call him,” I replied. “He’s in the barn, I’ve no doubt.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I went and called, but got no answer. On returning, I whispered to",Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure;",Wuthering Heights
768,and told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her,Wuthering Heights
768,"brother’s conduct regarding him. She jumped up in a fine fright, flung",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not",Wuthering Heights
768,"taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk",Wuthering Heights
768,would have affected him. She was absent such a while that Joseph,Wuthering Heights
768,proposed we should wait no longer. He cunningly conjectured they were,Wuthering Heights
768,staying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing. They,Wuthering Heights
768,"were “ill eneugh for ony fahl manners,” he affirmed. And on their",Wuthering Heights
768,behalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual,Wuthering Heights
768,"quarter-of-an-hour’s supplication before meat, and would have tacked",Wuthering Heights
768,"another to the end of the grace, had not his young mistress broken in",Wuthering Heights
768,"upon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road, and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and make him re-enter directly!",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I want to speak to him, and I _must_, before I go upstairs,” she said.",Wuthering Heights
768,“And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not,Wuthering Heights
768,"reply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to",Wuthering Heights
768,"suffer contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"walked grumbling forth. Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the",Wuthering Heights
768,"floor, exclaiming—“I wonder where he is—I wonder where he _can_ be!",Wuthering Heights
768,"What did I say, Nelly? I’ve forgotten. Was he vexed at my bad humour",Wuthering Heights
768,this afternoon? Dear! tell me what I’ve said to grieve him? I do wish,Wuthering Heights
768,he’d come. I do wish he would!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What a noise for nothing!” I cried, though rather uneasy myself. “What",Wuthering Heights
768,a trifle scares you! It’s surely no great cause of alarm that,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie",Wuthering Heights
768,too sulky to speak to us in the hay-loft. I’ll engage he’s lurking,Wuthering Heights
768,there. See if I don’t ferret him out!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and",Wuthering Heights
768,Joseph’s quest ended in the same.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Yon lad gets war und war!” observed he on re-entering. “He’s left th’,Wuthering Heights

768,"been looking for him, as I ordered?”",Wuthering Heights

768,"“I sud more likker look for th’ horse,” he replied. “It ’ud be to more",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,It _was_ a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined,Wuthering Heights
768,"to thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain",Wuthering Heights
768,"would be certain to bring him home without further trouble. However,",Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity. She kept wandering,Wuthering Heights
768,"to and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which",Wuthering Heights
768,permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one,Wuthering Heights
768,"side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations",Wuthering Heights
768,"and the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash",Wuthering Heights
768,"around her, she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"then crying outright. She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good",Wuthering Heights
768,passionate fit of crying.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heights in full fury. There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and",Wuthering Heights
768,either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building:,Wuthering Heights
768,"a huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"east chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the",Wuthering Heights
768,kitchen-fire. We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and,Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the",Wuthering Heights
768,"patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous,",Wuthering Heights
768,though he smote the ungodly. I felt some sentiment that it must be a,Wuthering Heights
768,"judgment on us also. The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I",Wuthering Heights
768,shook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet,Wuthering Heights
768,"living. He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion",Wuthering Heights
768,"vociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might",Wuthering Heights
768,be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master. But,Wuthering Heights
768,"the uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed;",Wuthering Heights
768,"excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in",Wuthering Heights
768,"refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless to",Wuthering Heights
768,catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes. She came in,Wuthering Heights
768,"and lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to",Wuthering Heights
768,"the back, and putting her hands before it.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, Miss!” I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; “you are not bent on",Wuthering Heights
768,"getting your death, are you? Do you know what o’clock it is? Half-past",Wuthering Heights
768,"twelve. Come, come to bed! there’s no use waiting any longer on that",Wuthering Heights
768,"foolish boy: he’ll be gone to Gimmerton, and he’ll stay there now. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"guesses we shouldn’t wait for him till this late hour: at least, he",Wuthering Heights
768,guesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he’d rather avoid having,Wuthering Heights
768,the door opened by the master.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nay, nay, he’s noan at Gimmerton,” said Joseph. “I’s niver wonder but",Wuthering Heights

768,"all! All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out",Wuthering Heights
768,fro’ th’ rubbidge! Yah knaw whet t’ Scripture ses.” And he began,Wuthering Heights
768,"quoting several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we",Wuthering Heights
768,might find them.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet",Wuthering Heights
768,"things, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed",Wuthering Heights
768,"with little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping",Wuthering Heights
768,round him. I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I,Wuthering Heights
768,"distinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing",Wuthering Heights
768,"the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the",Wuthering Heights
768,"fireplace. The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its",Wuthering Heights
768,"unclosed windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen",Wuthering Heights
768,"hearth, haggard and drowsy.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What ails you, Cathy?” he was saying when I entered: “you look as",Wuthering Heights
768,"dismal as a drowned whelp. Why are you so damp and pale, child?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ve been wet,” she answered reluctantly, “and I’m cold, that’s all.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, she is naughty!” I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably",Wuthering Heights
768,"sober. “She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there",Wuthering Heights
768,"she has sat the night through, and I couldn’t prevail on her to stir.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise. “The night through,” he",Wuthering Heights
768,"repeated. “What kept her up? not fear of the thunder, surely? That was",Wuthering Heights
768,over hours since.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff’s absence, as long as we",Wuthering Heights
768,"could conceal it; so I replied, I didn’t know how she took it into her",Wuthering Heights
768,head to sit up; and she said nothing. The morning was fresh and cool; I,Wuthering Heights
768,"threw back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents",Wuthering Heights
768,"from the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, “Ellen, shut the",Wuthering Heights
768,window. I’m starving!” And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to,Wuthering Heights
768,the almost extinguished embers.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She’s ill,” said Hindley, taking her wrist; “I suppose that’s the",Wuthering Heights
768,reason she would not go to bed. Damn it! I don’t want to be troubled,Wuthering Heights
768,with more sickness here. What took you into the rain?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Running after t’ lads, as usuald!” croaked Joseph, catching an",Wuthering Heights
768,opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue. “If I war,Wuthering Heights
768,"yah, maister, I’d just slam t’ boards i’ their faces all on ’em, gentle",Wuthering Heights
768,"and simple! Never a day ut yah’re off, but yon cat o’ Linton comes",Wuthering Heights
768,"sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo’s a fine lass! shoo sits watching",Wuthering Heights
768,"for ye i’ t’ kitchen; and as yah’re in at one door, he’s out at",Wuthering Heights
768,"t’other; and, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting of her side! It’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"bonny behaviour, lurking amang t’ fields, after twelve o’ t’ night, wi’",Wuthering Heights
768,"that fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff! They think _I’m_",Wuthering Heights
768,blind; but I’m noan: nowt ut t’ soart!—I seed young Linton boath coming,Wuthering Heights
768,"and going, and I seed _yah_” (directing his discourse to me), “yah",Wuthering Heights

768,minute yah heard t’ maister’s horse-fit clatter up t’ road.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Silence, eavesdropper!” cried Catherine; “none of your insolence",Wuthering Heights
768,"before me! Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was",Wuthering Heights
768,_I_ who told him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have,Wuthering Heights
768,met him as you were.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You lie, Cathy, no doubt,” answered her brother, “and you are a",Wuthering Heights
768,"confounded simpleton! But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were",Wuthering Heights
768,"you not with Heathcliff last night? Speak the truth, now. You need not",Wuthering Heights
768,"be afraid of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me",Wuthering Heights
768,a good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of,Wuthering Heights
768,"breaking his neck. To prevent it, I shall send him about his business",Wuthering Heights
768,"this very morning; and after he’s gone, I’d advise you all to look",Wuthering Heights
768,sharp: I shall only have the more humour for you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I never saw Heathcliff last night,” answered Catherine, beginning to",Wuthering Heights
768,"sob bitterly: “and if you do turn him out of doors, I’ll go with him.",Wuthering Heights
768,"But, perhaps, you’ll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he’s gone.”",Wuthering Heights
768,"Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her",Wuthering Heights
768,words were inarticulate.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get",Wuthering Heights
768,"to her room immediately, or she shouldn’t cry for nothing! I obliged",Wuthering Heights
768,her to obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we,Wuthering Heights
768,"reached her chamber: it terrified me. I thought she was going mad, and",Wuthering Heights
768,I begged Joseph to run for the doctor. It proved the commencement of,Wuthering Heights
768,"delirium: Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her",Wuthering Heights
768,"dangerously ill; she had a fever. He bled her, and he told me to let",Wuthering Heights
768,"her live on whey and water-gruel, and take care she did not throw",Wuthering Heights
768,herself downstairs or out of the window; and then he left: for he had,Wuthering Heights
768,"enough to do in the parish, where two or three miles was the ordinary",Wuthering Heights
768,distance between cottage and cottage.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master",Wuthering Heights
768,"were no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong",Wuthering Heights
768,"as a patient could be, she weathered it through. Old Mrs. Linton paid",Wuthering Heights
768,"us several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded",Wuthering Heights
768,"and ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted",Wuthering Heights
768,on conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were,Wuthering Heights
768,very grateful. But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness:,Wuthering Heights
768,"she and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of",Wuthering Heights
768,each other.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and",Wuthering Heights
768,haughtier than ever. Heathcliff had never been heard of since the,Wuthering Heights
768,"evening of the thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when",Wuthering Heights
768,"she had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance",Wuthering Heights
768,"on her: where indeed it belonged, as she well knew. From that period,",Wuthering Heights
768,"for several months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save",Wuthering Heights
768,in the relation of a mere servant. Joseph fell under a ban also: he,Wuthering Heights
768,"_would_ speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a",Wuthering Heights
768,"little girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and",Wuthering Heights
768,thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with,Wuthering Heights
768,consideration. Then the doctor had said that she would not bear,Wuthering Heights
768,crossing much; she ought to have her own way; and it was nothing less,Wuthering Heights
768,than murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and,Wuthering Heights
768,contradict her. From Mr. Earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof;,Wuthering Heights
768,"and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of a fit that often",Wuthering Heights
768,"attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to",Wuthering Heights
768,"demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper. He was",Wuthering Heights
768,"rather _too_ indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection,",Wuthering Heights
768,but from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the,Wuthering Heights
768,"family by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him",Wuthering Heights
768,"alone she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared! Edgar",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton, as multitudes have been before and will be after him, was",Wuthering Heights
768,infatuated: and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he,Wuthering Heights
768,"led her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father’s",Wuthering Heights
768,death.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights",Wuthering Heights
768,"and accompany her here. Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,had just begun to teach him his letters. We made a sad parting; but,Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine’s tears were more powerful than ours. When I refused to go,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting",Wuthering Heights
768,to her husband and brother. The former offered me munificent wages; the,Wuthering Heights
768,"latter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said,",Wuthering Heights
768,"now that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should",Wuthering Heights
768,"take him in hand, by-and-by. And so I had but one choice left: to do as",Wuthering Heights
768,I was ordered. I told the master he got rid of all decent people only,Wuthering Heights
768,"to run to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"since then he has been a stranger: and it’s very queer to think it, but",Wuthering Heights
768,"I’ve no doubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"A charming introduction to a hermit’s life! Four weeks’ torture,",Wuthering Heights
768,"tossing, and sickness! Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons! And oh, this",Wuthering Heights
768,"dearth of the human physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible",Wuthering Heights
768,intimation of Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till,Wuthering Heights
768,spring!,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call. About seven days ago,Wuthering Heights
768,he sent me a brace of grouse—the last of the season. Scoundrel! He is,Wuthering Heights
768,not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a,Wuthering Heights
768,"great mind to tell him. But, alas! how could I offend a man who was",Wuthering Heights
768,"charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some",Wuthering Heights
768,"other subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches? This is",Wuthering Heights
768,quite an easy interval. I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could,Wuthering Heights
768,enjoy something interesting. Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her,Wuthering Heights
768,"tale? I can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone. Yes:",Wuthering Heights
768,"I remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three",Wuthering Heights
768,years; and the heroine was married. I’ll ring: she’ll be delighted to,Wuthering Heights
768,find me capable of talking cheerfully. Mrs. Dean came.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine,” she commenced.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Away, away with it!” I replied; “I desire to have—”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“The doctor says you must drop the powders.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“With all my heart! Don’t interrupt me. Come and take your seat here.,Wuthering Heights
768,Keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials. Draw your knitting,Wuthering Heights
768,out of your pocket—that will do—now continue the history of Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day. Did he finish",Wuthering Heights
768,"his education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman? or did he",Wuthering Heights
768,"get a sizar’s place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours",Wuthering Heights
768,by drawing blood from his foster-country? or make a fortune more,Wuthering Heights
768,promptly on the English highways?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but I",Wuthering Heights
768,couldn’t give my word for any. I stated before that I didn’t know how,Wuthering Heights
768,he gained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise,Wuthering Heights
768,"his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with",Wuthering Heights
768,"your leave, I’ll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse",Wuthering Heights
768,and not weary you. Are you feeling better this morning?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Much.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“That’s good news.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,* * * * *,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my",Wuthering Heights
768,"agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to",Wuthering Heights
768,expect. She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his,Wuthering Heights
768,sister she showed plenty of affection. They were both very attentive to,Wuthering Heights
768,"her comfort, certainly. It was not the thorn bending to the",Wuthering Heights
768,"honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn. There were no",Wuthering Heights
768,"mutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who",Wuthering Heights
768,_can_ be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither,Wuthering Heights
768,opposition nor indifference? I observed that Mr. Edgar had a,Wuthering Heights
768,deep-rooted fear of ruffling her humour. He concealed it from her; but,Wuthering Heights
768,"if ever he heard me answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow",Wuthering Heights
768,"cloudy at some imperious order of hers, he would show his trouble by a",Wuthering Heights
768,frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account. He many a,Wuthering Heights
768,time spoke sternly to me about my pertness; and averred that the stab,Wuthering Heights
768,of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing,Wuthering Heights
768,"his lady vexed. Not to grieve a kind master, I learned to be less",Wuthering Heights
768,"touchy; and, for the space of half a year, the gunpowder lay as",Wuthering Heights
768,"harmless as sand, because no fire came near to explode it. Catherine",Wuthering Heights
768,had seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected with,Wuthering Heights
768,"sympathising silence by her husband, who ascribed them to an alteration",Wuthering Heights
768,"in her constitution, produced by her perilous illness; as she was never",Wuthering Heights
768,subject to depression of spirits before. The return of sunshine was,Wuthering Heights
768,welcomed by answering sunshine from him. I believe I may assert that,Wuthering Heights
768,they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"It ended. Well, we _must_ be for ourselves in the long run; the mild",Wuthering Heights
768,and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it,Wuthering Heights
768,ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the one’s interest,Wuthering Heights
768,was not the chief consideration in the other’s thoughts. On a mellow,Wuthering Heights
768,"evening in September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket",Wuthering Heights
768,"of apples which I had been gathering. It had got dusk, and the moon",Wuthering Heights
768,"looked over the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to",Wuthering Heights
768,lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"building. I set my burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"lingered to rest, and drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet",Wuthering Heights
768,"air; my eyes were on the moon, and my back to the entrance, when I",Wuthering Heights
768,"heard a voice behind me say,—“Nelly, is that you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in",Wuthering Heights
768,the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"turned about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut,",Wuthering Heights
768,and I had seen nobody on approaching the steps. Something stirred in,Wuthering Heights
768,"the porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in",Wuthering Heights
768,"dark clothes, with dark face and hair. He leant against the side, and",Wuthering Heights
768,held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself. “Who,Wuthering Heights
768,"can it be?” I thought. “Mr. Earnshaw? Oh, no! The voice has no",Wuthering Heights
768,resemblance to his.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I have waited here an hour,” he resumed, while I continued staring;",Wuthering Heights
768,“and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"dared not enter. You do not know me? Look, I’m not a stranger!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered",Wuthering Heights
768,"with black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and",Wuthering Heights
768,singular. I remembered the eyes.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What!” I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor,",Wuthering Heights
768,and I raised my hands in amazement. “What! you come back? Is it really,Wuthering Heights
768,you? Is it?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, Heathcliff,” he replied, glancing from me up to the windows,",Wuthering Heights
768,"which reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from",Wuthering Heights
768,"within. “Are they at home? where is she? Nelly, you are not glad! you",Wuthering Heights
768,needn’t be so disturbed. Is she here? Speak! I want to have one word,Wuthering Heights
768,"with her—your mistress. Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires",Wuthering Heights
768,to see her.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“How will she take it?” I exclaimed. “What will she do? The surprise,Wuthering Heights
768,bewilders me—it will put her out of her head! And you _are_ Heathcliff!,Wuthering Heights
768,"But altered! Nay, there’s no comprehending it. Have you been for a",Wuthering Heights
768,soldier?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Go and carry my message,” he interrupted, impatiently. “I’m in hell",Wuthering Heights
768,till you do!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where",Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed. At",Wuthering Heights
768,length I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the,Wuthering Heights
768,"candles lighted, and I opened the door.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the",Wuthering Heights
768,"valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top",Wuthering Heights
768,"(for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the",Wuthering Heights
768,sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of,Wuthering Heights
768,the glen). Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our,Wuthering Heights
768,old house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side. Both,Wuthering Heights
768,"the room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked",Wuthering Heights
768,wondrously peaceful. I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand;,Wuthering Heights
768,"and was actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my",Wuthering Heights
768,"question about the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to",Wuthering Heights
768,"return, and mutter, “A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma’am.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What does he want?” asked Mrs. Linton.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I did not question him,” I answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, close the curtains, Nelly,” she said; “and bring up tea. I’ll be",Wuthering Heights
768,back again directly.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Some one mistress does not expect,” I replied. “That Heathcliff—you",Wuthering Heights
768,"recollect him, sir—who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw’s.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What! the gipsy—the ploughboy?” he cried. “Why did you not say so to,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hush! you must not call him by those names, master,” I said. “She’d be",Wuthering Heights
768,sadly grieved to hear you. She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.,Wuthering Heights
768,I guess his return will make a jubilee to her.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that,Wuthering Heights
768,"overlooked the court. He unfastened it, and leant out. I suppose they",Wuthering Heights
768,"were below, for he exclaimed quickly: “Don’t stand there, love! Bring",Wuthering Heights
768,"the person in, if it be anyone particular.” Ere long, I heard the click",Wuthering Heights
768,"of the latch, and Catherine flew upstairs, breathless and wild; too",Wuthering Heights
768,"excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have",Wuthering Heights
768,surmised an awful calamity.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, Edgar, Edgar!” she panted, flinging her arms round his neck. “Oh,",Wuthering Heights
768,Edgar darling! Heathcliff’s come back—he is!” And she tightened her,Wuthering Heights
768,embrace to a squeeze.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, well,” cried her husband, crossly, “don’t strangle me for that!",Wuthering Heights
768,He never struck me as such a marvellous treasure. There is no need to,Wuthering Heights
768,be frantic!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I know you didn’t like him,” she answered, repressing a little the",Wuthering Heights
768,"intensity of her delight. “Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.",Wuthering Heights
768,Shall I tell him to come up?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Here,” he said, “into the parlour?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Where else?” she asked.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for",Wuthering Heights
768,"him. Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression—half angry, half",Wuthering Heights
768,laughing at his fastidiousness.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” she added, after a while; “I cannot sit in the kitchen. Set two",Wuthering Heights
768,"tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being",Wuthering Heights
768,"gentry; the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Will that please you, dear? Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere? If",Wuthering Heights
768,"so, give directions. I’ll run down and secure my guest. I’m afraid the",Wuthering Heights
768,joy is too great to be real!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“_You_ bid him step up,” he said, addressing me; “and, Catherine, try",Wuthering Heights
768,"to be glad, without being absurd. The whole household need not witness",Wuthering Heights
768,the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently",Wuthering Heights
768,anticipating an invitation to enter. He followed my guidance without,Wuthering Heights
768,"waste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and",Wuthering Heights
768,"mistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking. But the",Wuthering Heights
768,lady’s glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the,Wuthering Heights
768,"door: she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton;",Wuthering Heights
768,and then she seized Linton’s reluctant fingers and crushed them into,Wuthering Heights
768,"his. Now, fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed,",Wuthering Heights
768,"more than ever, to behold the transformation of Heathcliff. He had",Wuthering Heights
768,"grown a tall, athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed",Wuthering Heights
768,quite slender and youth-like. His upright carriage suggested the idea,Wuthering Heights
768,of his having been in the army. His countenance was much older in,Wuthering Heights
768,expression and decision of feature than Mr. Linton’s; it looked,Wuthering Heights
768,"intelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation. A",Wuthering Heights
768,half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full,Wuthering Heights
768,"of black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was even dignified:",Wuthering Heights
768,"quite divested of roughness, though too stern for grace. My master’s",Wuthering Heights
768,surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a minute at a loss,Wuthering Heights
768,"how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him. Heathcliff dropped",Wuthering Heights
768,"his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to",Wuthering Heights
768,speak.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Sit down, sir,” he said, at length. “Mrs. Linton, recalling old times,",Wuthering Heights
768,"would have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am",Wuthering Heights
768,gratified when anything occurs to please her.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And I also,” answered Heathcliff, “especially if it be anything in",Wuthering Heights
768,which I have a part. I shall stay an hour or two willingly.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if",Wuthering Heights
768,she feared he would vanish were she to remove it. He did not raise his,Wuthering Heights
768,to her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed,Wuthering Heights
768,"back, each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from",Wuthering Heights
768,hers. They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer,Wuthering Heights
768,embarrassment. Not so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a,Wuthering Heights
768,"feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across",Wuthering Heights
768,"the rug, seized Heathcliff’s hands again, and laughed like one beside",Wuthering Heights
768,herself.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“I shall think it a dream to-morrow!” she cried. “I shall not be able,Wuthering Heights
768,"to believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more.",Wuthering Heights
768,"And yet, cruel Heathcliff! you don’t deserve this welcome. To be absent",Wuthering Heights
768,"and silent for three years, and never to think of me!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“A little more than you have thought of me,” he murmured. “I heard of",Wuthering Heights
768,"your marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard",Wuthering Heights
768,"below, I meditated this plan—just to have one glimpse of your face, a",Wuthering Heights
768,"stare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle",Wuthering Heights
768,my score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on,Wuthering Heights
768,myself. Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of,Wuthering Heights
768,"meeting me with another aspect next time! Nay, you’ll not drive me off",Wuthering Heights
768,"again. You were really sorry for me, were you? Well, there was cause.",Wuthering Heights
768,I’ve fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and,Wuthering Heights
768,"you must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the",Wuthering Heights
768,"table,” interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"a due measure of politeness. “Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk,",Wuthering Heights
768,wherever he may lodge to-night; and I’m thirsty.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by",Wuthering Heights
768,"the bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room.",Wuthering Heights
768,The meal hardly endured ten minutes. Catherine’s cup was never filled:,Wuthering Heights
768,"she could neither eat nor drink. Edgar had made a slop in his saucer,",Wuthering Heights
768,and scarcely swallowed a mouthful. Their guest did not protract his,Wuthering Heights
768,"stay that evening above an hour longer. I asked, as he departed, if he",Wuthering Heights
768,went to Gimmerton?,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, to Wuthering Heights,” he answered: “Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when",Wuthering Heights
768,I called this morning.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Earnshaw invited _him_! and _he_ called on Mr. Earnshaw! I pondered,Wuthering Heights
768,"this sentence painfully, after he was gone. Is he turning out a bit of",Wuthering Heights
768,"a hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a",Wuthering Heights
768,cloak? I mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he,Wuthering Heights
768,had better have remained away.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and",Wuthering Heights
768,pulling me by the hair to rouse me.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I cannot rest, Ellen,” she said, by way of apology. “And I want some",Wuthering Heights
768,"living creature to keep me company in my happiness! Edgar is sulky,",Wuthering Heights
768,because I’m glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to,Wuthering Heights
768,"open his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he",Wuthering Heights
768,affirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so,Wuthering Heights
768,sick and sleepy. He always contrives to be sick at the least cross! I,Wuthering Heights
768,"gave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for",Wuthering Heights
768,"a headache or a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?” I answered. “As lads they,Wuthering Heights
768,"had an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much",Wuthering Heights
768,"to hear him praised: it’s human nature. Let Mr. Linton alone about him,",Wuthering Heights
768,unless you would like an open quarrel between them.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“But does it not show great weakness?” pursued she. “I’m not envious: I,Wuthering Heights
768,never feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella’s yellow hair and the,Wuthering Heights
768,"whiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the",Wuthering Heights
768,"family exhibit for her. Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute",Wuthering Heights
768,"sometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish",Wuthering Heights
768,"mother: I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good temper. It",Wuthering Heights
768,"pleases her brother to see us cordial, and that pleases me. But they",Wuthering Heights
768,"are very much alike: they are spoiled children, and fancy the world was",Wuthering Heights
768,"made for their accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart",Wuthering Heights
768,chastisement might improve them all the same.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’re mistaken, Mrs. Linton,” said I. “They humour you: I know what",Wuthering Heights
768,there would be to do if they did not. You can well afford to indulge,Wuthering Heights
768,their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your,Wuthering Heights
768,"desires. You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal",Wuthering Heights
768,consequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very,Wuthering Heights
768,capable of being as obstinate as you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And then we shall fight to the death, sha’n’t we, Nelly?” she",Wuthering Heights
768,"returned, laughing. “No! I tell you, I have such faith in Linton’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"love, that I believe I might kill him, and he wouldn’t wish to",Wuthering Heights
768,retaliate.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I advised her to value him the more for his affection.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I do,” she answered, “but he needn’t resort to whining for trifles. It",Wuthering Heights
768,"is childish; and, instead of melting into tears because I said that",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff was now worthy of anyone’s regard, and it would honour the",Wuthering Heights
768,"first gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said",Wuthering Heights
768,"it for me, and been delighted from sympathy. He must get accustomed to",Wuthering Heights
768,"him, and he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason",Wuthering Heights
768,"to object to him, I’m sure he behaved excellently!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?” I inquired. “He,Wuthering Heights
768,"is reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering",Wuthering Heights
768,the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He explained it,” she replied. “I wonder as much as you. He said he",Wuthering Heights
768,"called to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you",Wuthering Heights
768,"resided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to",Wuthering Heights
768,"questioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and finally, desired him to walk in. There were some persons sitting at",Wuthering Heights
768,"cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"finding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again",Wuthering Heights
768,in the evening: to which he consented. Hindley is too reckless to,Wuthering Heights
768,select his acquaintance prudently: he doesn’t trouble himself to,Wuthering Heights
768,reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has,Wuthering Heights
768,basely injured. But Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for,Wuthering Heights
768,resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install,Wuthering Heights
768,"himself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange, and an",Wuthering Heights
768,attachment to the house where we lived together; and likewise a hope,Wuthering Heights
768,that I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could,Wuthering Heights
768,have if he settled in Gimmerton. He means to offer liberal payment for,Wuthering Heights
768,permission to lodge at the Heights; and doubtless my brother’s,Wuthering Heights
768,covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms: he was always greedy;,Wuthering Heights
768,though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“It’s a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!” said I.,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Have you no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“None for my friend,” she replied: “his strong head will keep him from",Wuthering Heights
768,danger; a little for Hindley: but he can’t be made morally worse than,Wuthering Heights
768,he is; and I stand between him and bodily harm. The event of this,Wuthering Heights
768,evening has reconciled me to God and humanity! I had risen in angry,Wuthering Heights
768,"rebellion against Providence. Oh, I’ve endured very, very bitter",Wuthering Heights
768,"misery, Nelly! If that creature knew how bitter, he’d be ashamed to",Wuthering Heights
768,cloud its removal with idle petulance. It was kindness for him which,Wuthering Heights
768,induced me to bear it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently,Wuthering Heights
768,"felt, he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently",Wuthering Heights
768,"as I. However, it’s over, and I’ll take no revenge on his folly; I can",Wuthering Heights
768,afford to suffer anything hereafter! Should the meanest thing alive,Wuthering Heights
768,"slap me on the cheek, I’d not only turn the other, but I’d ask pardon",Wuthering Heights
768,"for provoking it; and, as a proof, I’ll go make my peace with Edgar",Wuthering Heights
768,instantly. Good-night! I’m an angel!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her,Wuthering Heights
768,fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only,Wuthering Heights
768,abjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by,Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine’s exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to",Wuthering Heights
768,her taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and,Wuthering Heights
768,she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in,Wuthering Heights
768,return as made the house a paradise for several days; both master and,Wuthering Heights
768,servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff—Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future—used the liberty of,Wuthering Heights
768,"visiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed",Wuthering Heights
768,"estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion. Catherine, also,",Wuthering Heights
768,deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in,Wuthering Heights
768,receiving him; and he gradually established his right to be expected.,Wuthering Heights
768,He retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was,Wuthering Heights
768,remarkable; and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of,Wuthering Heights
768,"feeling. My master’s uneasiness experienced a lull, and further",Wuthering Heights
768,circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of,Wuthering Heights
768,Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards,Wuthering Heights
768,the tolerated guest. She was at that time a charming young lady of,Wuthering Heights
768,"eighteen; infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen",Wuthering Heights
768,"feelings, and a keen temper, too, if irritated. Her brother, who loved",Wuthering Heights
768,"her tenderly, was appalled at this fantastic preference. Leaving aside",Wuthering Heights
768,"the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible",Wuthering Heights
768,"fact that his property, in default of heirs male, might pass into such",Wuthering Heights
768,"a one’s power, he had sense to comprehend Heathcliff’s disposition: to",Wuthering Heights
768,"know that, though his exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable",Wuthering Heights
768,and unchanged. And he dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank,Wuthering Heights
768,forebodingly from the idea of committing Isabella to its keeping. He,Wuthering Heights
768,would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment,Wuthering Heights
768,"rose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation",Wuthering Heights
768,of sentiment; for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the,Wuthering Heights
768,blame on Heathcliff’s deliberate designing.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and",Wuthering Heights
768,pined over something. She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and,Wuthering Heights
768,"teasing Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her",Wuthering Heights
768,"limited patience. We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of",Wuthering Heights
768,"ill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes. But one day,",Wuthering Heights
768,"when she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast,",Wuthering Heights
768,complaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the,Wuthering Heights
768,"mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar",Wuthering Heights
768,neglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left,Wuthering Heights
768,"open, and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a",Wuthering Heights
768,"hundred yet more frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily",Wuthering Heights
768,"insisted that she should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily,",Wuthering Heights
768,threatened to send for the doctor. Mention of Kenneth caused her to,Wuthering Heights
768,"exclaim, instantly, that her health was perfect, and it was only",Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine’s harshness which made her unhappy.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?” cried the mistress,",Wuthering Heights
768,amazed at the unreasonable assertion. “You are surely losing your,Wuthering Heights
768,"reason. When have I been harsh, tell me?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yesterday,” sobbed Isabella, “and now!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Yesterday!” said her sister-in-law. “On what occasion?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased,",Wuthering Heights
768,while you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And that’s your notion of harshness?” said Catherine, laughing. “It",Wuthering Heights
768,was no hint that your company was superfluous; we didn’t care whether,Wuthering Heights
768,you kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff’s talk would have,Wuthering Heights
768,nothing entertaining for your ears.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, no,” wept the young lady; “you wished me away, because you knew I",Wuthering Heights
768,liked to be there!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is she sane?” asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me. “I’ll repeat our",Wuthering Heights
768,"conversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it",Wuthering Heights
768,could have had for you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I don’t mind the conversation,” she answered: “I wanted to be with—”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well?” said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the",Wuthering Heights
768,sentence.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“With him: and I won’t be always sent off!” she continued, kindling up.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but",Wuthering Heights
768,yourself!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You are an impertinent little monkey!” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in",Wuthering Heights
768,surprise. “But I’ll not believe this idiocy! It is impossible that you,Wuthering Heights
768,can covet the admiration of Heathcliff—that you consider him an,Wuthering Heights
768,"agreeable person! I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, you have not,” said the infatuated girl. “I love him more than",Wuthering Heights
768,"ever you loved Edgar, and he might love me, if you would let him!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I wouldn’t be you for a kingdom, then!” Catherine declared,",Wuthering Heights
768,"emphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely. “Nelly, help me to",Wuthering Heights
768,convince her of her madness. Tell her what Heathcliff is: an,Wuthering Heights
768,"unreclaimed creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid",Wuthering Heights
768,wilderness of furze and whinstone. I’d as soon put that little canary,Wuthering Heights
768,"into the park on a winter’s day, as recommend you to bestow your heart",Wuthering Heights
768,"on him! It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing",Wuthering Heights
768,"else, which makes that dream enter your head. Pray, don’t imagine that",Wuthering Heights
768,he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern,Wuthering Heights
768,exterior! He’s not a rough diamond—a pearl-containing oyster of a,Wuthering Heights
768,"rustic: he’s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man. I never say to him, ‘Let",Wuthering Heights
768,"this or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to",Wuthering Heights
768,"harm them;’ I say, ‘Let them alone, because _I_ should hate them to be",Wuthering Heights
768,"wronged:’ and he’d crush you like a sparrow’s egg, Isabella, if he",Wuthering Heights
768,found you a troublesome charge. I know he couldn’t love a Linton; and,Wuthering Heights
768,yet he’d be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations:,Wuthering Heights
768,avarice is growing with him a besetting sin. There’s my picture: and,Wuthering Heights
768,"I’m his friend—so much so, that had he thought seriously to catch you,",Wuthering Heights
768,"I should, perhaps, have held my tongue, and let you fall into his",Wuthering Heights
768,trap.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“For shame! for shame!” she repeated, angrily. “You are worse than",Wuthering Heights
768,"twenty foes, you poisonous friend!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ah! you won’t believe me, then?” said Catherine. “You think I speak",Wuthering Heights
768,from wicked selfishness?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m certain you do,” retorted Isabella; “and I shudder at you!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Good!” cried the other. “Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I",Wuthering Heights
768,"have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.”—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And I must suffer for her egotism!” she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left",Wuthering Heights
768,"the room. “All, all is against me: she has blighted my single",Wuthering Heights
768,"consolation. But she uttered falsehoods, didn’t she? Mr. Heathcliff is",Wuthering Heights
768,"not a fiend: he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he",Wuthering Heights
768,remember her?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Banish him from your thoughts, Miss,” I said. “He’s a bird of bad",Wuthering Heights
768,"omen: no mate for you. Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can’t",Wuthering Heights
768,"contradict her. She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or any",Wuthering Heights
768,one besides; and she never would represent him as worse than he is.,Wuthering Heights
768,Honest people don’t hide their deeds. How has he been living? how has,Wuthering Heights
768,"he got rich? why is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man",Wuthering Heights
768,whom he abhors? They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came.,Wuthering Heights
768,"They sit up all night together continually, and Hindley has been",Wuthering Heights
768,"borrowing money on his land, and does nothing but play and drink: I",Wuthering Heights
768,heard only a week ago—it was Joseph who told me—I met him at Gimmerton:,Wuthering Heights

768,"afore to oppen t’ pikes!’ Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an old rascal,",Wuthering Heights
768,"but no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff’s conduct be true, you",Wuthering Heights
768,"would never think of desiring such a husband, would you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!” she replied. “I’ll not listen",Wuthering Heights
768,to your slanders. What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me,Wuthering Heights
768,that there is no happiness in the world!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or",Wuthering Heights
768,"persevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time",Wuthering Heights
768,"to reflect. The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next",Wuthering Heights
768,"town; my master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his",Wuthering Heights
768,"absence, called rather earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were",Wuthering Heights
768,"sitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter",Wuthering Heights
768,"alarmed at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of",Wuthering Heights
768,"her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on",Wuthering Heights
768,"mature consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she",Wuthering Heights
768,"laughed again at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter",Wuthering Heights
768,to _her_. She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window. I was,Wuthering Heights
768,"sweeping the hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Isabella, absorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the",Wuthering Heights
768,"door opened; and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would",Wuthering Heights
768,gladly have done had it been practicable.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Come in, that’s right!” exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair",Wuthering Heights
768,to the fire. “Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the,Wuthering Heights
768,ice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, I’m proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you",Wuthering Heights
768,"more than myself. I expect you to feel flattered. Nay, it’s not Nelly;",Wuthering Heights
768,don’t look at her! My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart,Wuthering Heights
768,by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty. It lies in,Wuthering Heights
768,"your own power to be Edgar’s brother! No, no, Isabella, you sha’n’t run",Wuthering Heights
768,"off,” she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the",Wuthering Heights
768,"confounded girl, who had risen indignantly. “We were quarrelling like",Wuthering Heights
768,"cats about you, Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of",Wuthering Heights
768,"devotion and admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would",Wuthering Heights
768,"but have the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself",Wuthering Heights
768,"to be, would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever,",Wuthering Heights
768,and send my image into eternal oblivion!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Catherine!” said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to",Wuthering Heights
768,"struggle from the tight grasp that held her, “I’d thank you to adhere",Wuthering Heights
768,"to the truth and not slander me, even in joke! Mr. Heathcliff, be kind",Wuthering Heights
768,enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and,Wuthering Heights
768,I are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me,Wuthering Heights
768,beyond expression.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly",Wuthering Heights
768,"indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned",Wuthering Heights
768,and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“By no means!” cried Mrs. Linton in answer. “I won’t be named a dog in,Wuthering Heights
768,"the manger again. You _shall_ stay: now then! Heathcliff, why don’t you",Wuthering Heights
768,evince satisfaction at my pleasant news? Isabella swears that the love,Wuthering Heights
768,Edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you. I’m sure,Wuthering Heights
768,"she made some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen? And she has",Wuthering Heights
768,"fasted ever since the day before yesterday’s walk, from sorrow and rage",Wuthering Heights
768,that I despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being,Wuthering Heights
768,unacceptable.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I think you belie her,” said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face",Wuthering Heights
768,"them. “She wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a",Wuthering Heights
768,"strange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance,",Wuthering Heights
768,which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it,Wuthering Heights
768,raises. The poor thing couldn’t bear that; she grew white and red in,Wuthering Heights
768,"rapid succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength",Wuthering Heights
768,of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and,Wuthering Heights
768,perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another,Wuthering Heights
768,"closed down, and she could not remove the whole together, she began to",Wuthering Heights
768,make use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the,Wuthering Heights
768,detainer’s with crescents of red.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There’s a tigress!” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"shaking her hand with pain. “Begone, for God’s sake, and hide your",Wuthering Heights
768,vixen face! How foolish to reveal those talons to _him_. Can’t you,Wuthering Heights
768,"fancy the conclusions he’ll draw? Look, Heathcliff! they are",Wuthering Heights
768,instruments that will do execution—you must beware of your eyes.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’d wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,” he",Wuthering Heights
768,"answered, brutally, when the door had closed after her. “But what did",Wuthering Heights
768,"you mean by teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy? You were not",Wuthering Heights
768,"speaking the truth, were you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I assure you I was,” she returned. “She has been dying for your sake",Wuthering Heights
768,"several weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a",Wuthering Heights
768,"deluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light,",Wuthering Heights
768,for the purpose of mitigating her adoration. But don’t notice it,Wuthering Heights
768,"further: I wished to punish her sauciness, that’s all. I like her too",Wuthering Heights
768,"well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her",Wuthering Heights
768,up.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And I like her too ill to attempt it,” said he, “except in a very",Wuthering Heights
768,ghoulish fashion. You’d hear of odd things if I lived alone with that,Wuthering Heights
768,"mawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white",Wuthering Heights
768,"the colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day",Wuthering Heights
768,or two: they detestably resemble Linton’s.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Delectably!” observed Catherine. “They are dove’s eyes—angel’s!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She’s her brother’s heir, is she not?” he asked, after a brief",Wuthering Heights
768,silence.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I should be sorry to think so,” returned his companion. “Half a dozen",Wuthering Heights
768,"nephews shall erase her title, please heaven! Abstract your mind from",Wuthering Heights
768,the subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour’s,Wuthering Heights
768,goods; remember _this_ neighbour’s goods are mine.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“If they were _mine_, they would be none the less that,” said",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff; “but though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely",Wuthering Heights
768,"mad; and, in short, we’ll dismiss the matter, as you advise.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from",Wuthering Heights
768,"her thoughts. The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the",Wuthering Heights
768,course of the evening. I saw him smile to himself—grin rather—and lapse,Wuthering Heights
768,into ominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from,Wuthering Heights
768,the apartment.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I determined to watch his movements. My heart invariably cleaved to the,Wuthering Heights
768,"master’s, in preference to Catherine’s side: with reason I imagined,",Wuthering Heights
768,"for he was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she—she could not be",Wuthering Heights
768,"called the _opposite_, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide",Wuthering Heights
768,"latitude, that I had little faith in her principles, and still less",Wuthering Heights
768,sympathy for her feelings. I wanted something to happen which might,Wuthering Heights
768,have the effect of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, quietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his advent. His",Wuthering Heights
768,"visits were a continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master",Wuthering Heights
768,also. His abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining. I,Wuthering Heights
768,felt that God had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked,Wuthering Heights
768,"wanderings, and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting",Wuthering Heights
768,his time to spring and destroy.,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XI,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I’ve got up in",Wuthering Heights
768,"a sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the",Wuthering Heights
768,farm. I’ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how,Wuthering Heights
768,people talked regarding his ways; and then I’ve recollected his,Wuthering Heights
768,"confirmed bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched",Wuthering Heights
768,"from re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken",Wuthering Heights
768,at my word.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to",Wuthering Heights
768,Gimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a,Wuthering Heights
768,"bright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I",Wuthering Heights
768,came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your,Wuthering Heights
768,"left hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north",Wuthering Heights
768,"side, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a",Wuthering Heights
768,"guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village. The sun shone",Wuthering Heights
768,"yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why,",Wuthering Heights
768,but all at once a gush of child’s sensations flowed into my heart.,Wuthering Heights
768,Hindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed,Wuthering Heights
768,"long at the weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole",Wuthering Heights
768,"near the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were",Wuthering Heights
768,"fond of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as",Wuthering Heights
768,"reality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on the",Wuthering Heights
768,"withered turf: his dark, square head bent forward, and his little hand",Wuthering Heights
768,scooping out the earth with a piece of slate. “Poor Hindley!” I,Wuthering Heights
768,"exclaimed, involuntarily. I started: my bodily eye was cheated into a",Wuthering Heights
768,momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight,Wuthering Heights
768,into mine! It vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt an,Wuthering Heights
768,irresistible yearning to be at the Heights. Superstition urged me to,Wuthering Heights
768,comply with this impulse: supposing he should be dead! I thought—or,Wuthering Heights
768,should die soon!—supposing it were a sign of death! The nearer I got to,Wuthering Heights
768,the house the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of it I,Wuthering Heights
768,trembled in every limb. The apparition had outstripped me: it stood,Wuthering Heights
768,looking through the gate. That was my first idea on observing an,Wuthering Heights
768,"elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the",Wuthering Heights
768,"bars. Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton, _my_ Hareton,",Wuthering Heights
768,"not altered greatly since I left him, ten months since.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“God bless thee, darling!” I cried, forgetting instantaneously my",Wuthering Heights
768,"foolish fears. “Hareton, it’s Nelly! Nelly, thy nurse.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He retreated out of arm’s length, and picked up a large flint.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I am come to see thy father, Hareton,” I added, guessing from the",Wuthering Heights
768,"action that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not",Wuthering Heights
768,recognised as one with me.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but",Wuthering Heights
768,"could not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued,",Wuthering Heights
768,"from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses,",Wuthering Heights
768,"which, whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with",Wuthering Heights
768,"practised emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking",Wuthering Heights
768,expression of malignity. You may be certain this grieved more than,Wuthering Heights
768,"angered me. Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it",Wuthering Heights
768,"to propitiate him. He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as",Wuthering Heights
768,if he fancied I only intended to tempt and disappoint him. I showed,Wuthering Heights
768,"another, keeping it out of his reach.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?” I inquired. “The",Wuthering Heights
768,curate?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Damn the curate, and thee! Gie me that,” he replied.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,” said I.",Wuthering Heights
768,“Who’s your master?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Devil daddy,” was his answer.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And what do you learn from daddy?” I continued.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher. “What does he teach you?” I,Wuthering Heights
768,asked.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Naught,” said he, “but to keep out of his gait. Daddy cannot bide me,",Wuthering Heights
768,because I swear at him.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?” I observed.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ay—nay,” he drawled.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Who, then?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Heathcliff.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Ay!” he answered again.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the",Wuthering Heights
768,sentences—“I known’t: he pays dad back what he gies to me—he curses,Wuthering Heights
768,daddy for cursing me. He says I mun do as I will.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?” I pursued.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, I was told the curate should have his —— teeth dashed down his ——",Wuthering Heights
768,"throat, if he stepped over the threshold—Heathcliff had promised that!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman",Wuthering Heights
768,"called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley,",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran,Wuthering Heights
768,"down the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I",Wuthering Heights
768,"gained the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a",Wuthering Heights
768,goblin. This is not much connected with Miss Isabella’s affair: except,Wuthering Heights
768,"that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and",Wuthering Heights
768,doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the,Wuthering Heights
768,"Grange: even though I should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs.",Wuthering Heights
768,Linton’s pleasure.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some,Wuthering Heights
768,pigeons in the court. She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law,Wuthering Heights
768,"for three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining,",Wuthering Heights
768,and we found it a great comfort. Heathcliff had not the habit of,Wuthering Heights
768,"bestowing a single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew. Now, as",Wuthering Heights
768,"soon as he beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping",Wuthering Heights
768,"survey of the house-front. I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I",Wuthering Heights
768,"drew out of sight. He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said",Wuthering Heights
768,"something: she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to",Wuthering Heights
768,"prevent it, he laid his hand on her arm. She averted her face: he",Wuthering Heights
768,apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer. There was,Wuthering Heights
768,"another rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the",Wuthering Heights
768,scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Judas! Traitor!” I ejaculated. “You are a hypocrite, too, are you? A",Wuthering Heights
768,deliberate deceiver.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Who is, Nelly?” said Catherine’s voice at my elbow: I had been",Wuthering Heights
768,over-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Your worthless friend!” I answered, warmly: “the sneaking rascal",Wuthering Heights
768,"yonder. Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us—he is coming in! I wonder",Wuthering Heights
768,will he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to,Wuthering Heights
768,"Miss, when he told you he hated her?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door. I couldn’t withhold",Wuthering Heights
768,giving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on,Wuthering Heights
768,"silence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to",Wuthering Heights
768,be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!” she cried.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“You want setting down in your right place! Heathcliff, what are you",Wuthering Heights
768,"about, raising this stir? I said you must let Isabella alone!—I beg you",Wuthering Heights
768,"will, unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to",Wuthering Heights
768,draw the bolts against you!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“God forbid that he should try!” answered the black villain. I detested,Wuthering Heights
768,him just then. “God keep him meek and patient! Every day I grow madder,Wuthering Heights
768,after sending him to heaven!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hush!” said Catherine, shutting the inner door. “Don’t vex me. Why",Wuthering Heights
768,have you disregarded my request? Did she come across you on purpose?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What is it to you?” he growled. “I have a right to kiss her, if she",Wuthering Heights
768,chooses; and you have no right to object. I am not _your_ husband:,Wuthering Heights
768,_you_ needn’t be jealous of me!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m not jealous of you,” replied the mistress; “I’m jealous for you.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Clear your face: you sha’n’t scowl at me! If you like Isabella, you",Wuthering Heights
768,"shall marry her. But do you like her? Tell the truth, Heathcliff!",Wuthering Heights
768,"There, you won’t answer. I’m certain you don’t.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?” I,Wuthering Heights
768,inquired.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mr. Linton should approve,” returned my lady, decisively.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He might spare himself the trouble,” said Heathcliff: “I could do as",Wuthering Heights
768,"well without his approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind",Wuthering Heights
768,"to speak a few words now, while we are at it. I want you to be aware",Wuthering Heights
768,that I _know_ you have treated me infernally—infernally! Do you hear?,Wuthering Heights
768,"And if you flatter yourself that I don’t perceive it, you are a fool;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot:",Wuthering Heights
768,"and if you fancy I’ll suffer unrevenged, I’ll convince you of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"contrary, in a very little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me",Wuthering Heights
768,your sister-in-law’s secret: I swear I’ll make the most of it. And,Wuthering Heights
768,stand you aside!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What new phase of his character is this?” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in",Wuthering Heights
768,amazement. “I’ve treated you infernally—and you’ll take your revenge!,Wuthering Heights
768,"How will you take it, ungrateful brute? How have I treated you",Wuthering Heights
768,infernally?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I seek no revenge on you,” replied Heathcliff, less vehemently.",Wuthering Heights
768,“That’s not the plan. The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don’t,Wuthering Heights
768,turn against him; they crush those beneath them. You are welcome to,Wuthering Heights
768,"torture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a",Wuthering Heights
768,"little in the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are",Wuthering Heights
768,"able. Having levelled my palace, don’t erect a hovel and complacently",Wuthering Heights
768,admire your own charity in giving me that for a home. If I imagined you,Wuthering Heights
768,"really wished me to marry Isabel, I’d cut my throat!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?” cried Catherine.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, I won’t repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering",Wuthering Heights
768,"Satan a lost soul. Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery. You",Wuthering Heights
768,prove it. Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your,Wuthering Heights
768,"coming; I begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us",Wuthering Heights
768,"at peace, appear resolved on exciting a quarrel. Quarrel with Edgar, if",Wuthering Heights
768,"you please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you’ll hit on exactly",Wuthering Heights
768,the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The conversation ceased. Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and",Wuthering Heights
768,gloomy. The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could,Wuthering Heights
768,"neither lay nor control it. He stood on the hearth with folded arms,",Wuthering Heights
768,brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek,Wuthering Heights
768,"the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ellen,” said he, when I entered, “have you seen your mistress?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes; she’s in the kitchen, sir,” I answered. “She’s sadly put out by",Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. Heathcliff’s behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it’s time to",Wuthering Heights
768,"arrange his visits on another footing. There’s harm in being too soft,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and now it’s come to this—.” And I related the scene in the court, and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"as near as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute. I fancied it could",Wuthering Heights
768,not be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so,Wuthering Heights
768,"afterwards, by assuming the defensive for her guest. Edgar Linton had",Wuthering Heights
768,difficulty in hearing me to the close. His first words revealed that he,Wuthering Heights
768,did not clear his wife of blame.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“This is insufferable!” he exclaimed. “It is disgraceful that she,Wuthering Heights
768,"should own him for a friend, and force his company on me! Call me two",Wuthering Heights
768,"men out of the hall, Ellen. Catherine shall linger no longer to argue",Wuthering Heights
768,with the low ruffian—I have humoured her enough.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,",Wuthering Heights
768,"followed by me, to the kitchen. Its occupants had recommenced their",Wuthering Heights
768,"angry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed",Wuthering Heights
768,"vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat",Wuthering Heights
768,"cowed by her violent rating apparently. He saw the master first, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed,",Wuthering Heights
768,"abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“How is this?” said Linton, addressing her; “what notion of propriety",Wuthering Heights
768,"must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to",Wuthering Heights
768,"you by that blackguard? I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you",Wuthering Heights
768,"think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps,",Wuthering Heights
768,imagine I can get used to it too!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?” asked the mistress, in a",Wuthering Heights
768,"tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both",Wuthering Heights
768,"carelessness and contempt of his irritation. Heathcliff, who had raised",Wuthering Heights
768,"his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on",Wuthering Heights
768,"purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton’s attention to him. He",Wuthering Heights
768,succeeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high,Wuthering Heights
768,flights of passion.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ve been so far forbearing with you, sir,” he said quietly; “not that",Wuthering Heights
768,"I was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you",Wuthering Heights
768,were only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up,Wuthering Heights
768,"your acquaintance, I acquiesced—foolishly. Your presence is a moral",Wuthering Heights
768,"poison that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to",Wuthering Heights
768,"prevent worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into",Wuthering Heights
768,"this house, and give notice now that I require your instant departure.",Wuthering Heights
768,Three minutes’ delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye,Wuthering Heights
768,full of derision.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!” he said. “It is in",Wuthering Heights
768,"danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles. By God! Mr. Linton,",Wuthering Heights
768,I’m mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men:",Wuthering Heights
768,he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter. I obeyed the,Wuthering Heights
768,"hint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I",Wuthering Heights
768,"attempted to call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and",Wuthering Heights
768,locked it.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Fair means!” she said, in answer to her husband’s look of angry",Wuthering Heights
768,"surprise. “If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or",Wuthering Heights
768,allow yourself to be beaten. It will correct you of feigning more,Wuthering Heights
768,"valour than you possess. No, I’ll swallow the key before you shall get",Wuthering Heights
768,it! I’m delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each! After constant,Wuthering Heights
768,"indulgence of one’s weak nature, and the other’s bad one, I earn for",Wuthering Heights
768,"thanks two samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity! Edgar, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"was defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick,",Wuthering Heights
768,for daring to think an evil thought of me!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the,Wuthering Heights
768,"master. He tried to wrest the key from Catherine’s grasp, and for",Wuthering Heights
768,safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Edgar was taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew",Wuthering Heights
768,deadly pale. For his life he could not avert that excess of emotion:,Wuthering Heights
768,mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely. He leant on,Wuthering Heights
768,"the back of a chair, and covered his face.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, heavens! In old days this would win you knighthood!” exclaimed",Wuthering Heights
768,Mrs. Linton. “We are vanquished! we are vanquished! Heathcliff would as,Wuthering Heights
768,soon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a,Wuthering Heights
768,"colony of mice. Cheer up! you sha’n’t be hurt! Your type is not a lamb,",Wuthering Heights
768,it’s a sucking leveret.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!” said her friend. “I",Wuthering Heights
768,"compliment you on your taste. And that is the slavering, shivering",Wuthering Heights
768,"thing you preferred to me! I would not strike him with my fist, but I’d",Wuthering Heights
768,"kick him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction. Is he",Wuthering Heights
768,"weeping, or is he going to faint for fear?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push.,Wuthering Heights
768,"He’d better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and",Wuthering Heights
768,struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a,Wuthering Heights
768,"slighter man. It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to",Wuthering Heights
768,the front entrance.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There! you’ve done with coming here,” cried Catherine. “Get away, now;",Wuthering Heights
768,he’ll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants. If he,Wuthering Heights
768,"did overhear us, of course he’d never forgive you. You’ve played me an",Wuthering Heights
768,"ill turn, Heathcliff! But go—make haste! I’d rather see Edgar at bay",Wuthering Heights
768,than you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Do you suppose I’m going with that blow burning in my gullet?” he,Wuthering Heights
768,"thundered. “By hell, no! I’ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut",Wuthering Heights
768,"before I cross the threshold! If I don’t floor him now, I shall murder",Wuthering Heights
768,"him some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He is not coming,” I interposed, framing a bit of a lie. “There’s the",Wuthering Heights
768,coachman and the two gardeners; you’ll surely not wait to be thrust,Wuthering Heights
768,"into the road by them! Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very",Wuthering Heights
768,"likely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil",Wuthering Heights
768,his orders.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The gardeners and coachman _were_ there: but Linton was with them. They,Wuthering Heights
768,"had already entered the court. Heathcliff, on the second thoughts,",Wuthering Heights
768,resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the,Wuthering Heights
768,"poker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as",Wuthering Heights
768,they tramped in.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her upstairs.",Wuthering Heights
768,"She did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was",Wuthering Heights
768,anxious to keep her in ignorance.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m nearly distracted, Nelly!” she exclaimed, throwing herself on the",Wuthering Heights
768,sofa. “A thousand smiths’ hammers are beating in my head! Tell Isabella,Wuthering Heights
768,to shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else,Wuthering Heights
768,"aggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild. And, Nelly, say to",Wuthering Heights
768,"Edgar, if you see him again to-night, that I’m in danger of being",Wuthering Heights
768,seriously ill. I wish it may prove true. He has startled and distressed,Wuthering Heights
768,"me shockingly! I want to frighten him. Besides, he might come and begin",Wuthering Heights
768,"a string of abuse or complainings; I’m certain I should recriminate,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and God knows where we should end! Will you do so, my good Nelly? You",Wuthering Heights
768,are aware that I am no way blamable in this matter. What possessed him,Wuthering Heights
768,"to turn listener? Heathcliff’s talk was outrageous, after you left us;",Wuthering Heights
768,"but I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant",Wuthering Heights
768,nothing. Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool’s craving to hear evil of,Wuthering Heights
768,"self, that haunts some people like a demon! Had Edgar never gathered",Wuthering Heights
768,"our conversation, he would never have been the worse for it. Really,",Wuthering Heights
768,when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I,Wuthering Heights
768,had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for _him;_ I did not care,Wuthering Heights
768,"hardly what they did to each other; especially as I felt that, however",Wuthering Heights
768,"the scene closed, we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how",Wuthering Heights
768,"long! Well, if I cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend—if Edgar will be",Wuthering Heights
768,"mean and jealous, I’ll try to break their hearts by breaking my own.",Wuthering Heights
768,"That will be a prompt way of finishing all, when I am pushed to",Wuthering Heights
768,extremity! But it’s a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope; I’d not,Wuthering Heights
768,take Linton by surprise with it. To this point he has been discreet in,Wuthering Heights
768,dreading to provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting that,Wuthering Heights
768,"policy, and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled,",Wuthering Heights
768,on frenzy. I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that,Wuthering Heights
768,"countenance, and look rather more anxious about me.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt,",Wuthering Heights
768,rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but,Wuthering Heights
768,I believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion,Wuthering Heights
768,"to account, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control",Wuthering Heights
768,"herself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish",Wuthering Heights
768,"to “frighten” her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for",Wuthering Heights
768,the purpose of serving her selfishness. Therefore I said nothing when I,Wuthering Heights
768,met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of,Wuthering Heights
768,turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel,Wuthering Heights
768,together. He began to speak first.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Remain where you are, Catherine,” he said; without any anger in his",Wuthering Heights
768,"voice, but with much sorrowful despondency. “I shall not stay. I am",Wuthering Heights
768,neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn,Wuthering Heights
768,"whether, after this evening’s events, you intend to continue your",Wuthering Heights
768,intimacy with—”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, for mercy’s sake,” interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot,",Wuthering Heights
768,"“for mercy’s sake, let us hear no more of it now! Your cold blood",Wuthering Heights
768,cannot be worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but,Wuthering Heights
768,"mine are boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“To get rid of me, answer my question,” persevered Mr. Linton. “You",Wuthering Heights
768,_must_ answer it; and that violence does not alarm me. I have found,Wuthering Heights
768,"that you can be as stoical as anyone, when you please. Will you give up",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me? It is impossible for you",Wuthering Heights
768,to be _my_ friend and _his_ at the same time; and I absolutely,Wuthering Heights
768,_require_ to know which you choose.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I require to be let alone!” exclaimed Catherine, furiously. “I demand",Wuthering Heights
768,"it! Don’t you see I can scarcely stand? Edgar, you—you leave me!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely. It,Wuthering Heights
768,"was enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages!",Wuthering Heights
768,"There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"grinding her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to",Wuthering Heights
768,splinters! Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and,Wuthering Heights
768,fear. He told me to fetch some water. She had no breath for speaking. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"brought a glass full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her",Wuthering Heights
768,"face. In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up",Wuthering Heights
768,"her eyes, while her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the",Wuthering Heights
768,aspect of death. Linton looked terrified.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There is nothing in the world the matter,” I whispered. I did not want",Wuthering Heights
768,"him to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She has blood on her lips!” he said, shuddering.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Never mind!” I answered, tartly. And I told him how she had resolved,",Wuthering Heights
768,"previous to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. I incautiously",Wuthering Heights
768,"gave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up—her hair",Wuthering Heights
768,"flying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck",Wuthering Heights
768,and arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my mind for broken,Wuthering Heights
768,"bones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then",Wuthering Heights
768,"rushed from the room. The master directed me to follow; I did, to her",Wuthering Heights
768,chamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against,Wuthering Heights
768,me.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to",Wuthering Heights
768,"ask whether she would have some carried up. “No!” she replied,",Wuthering Heights
768,peremptorily. The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and,Wuthering Heights
768,"again on the morrow after, and received the same answer. Mr. Linton, on",Wuthering Heights
768,"his part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire concerning",Wuthering Heights
768,"his wife’s occupations. Isabella and he had had an hour’s interview,",Wuthering Heights
768,during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper,Wuthering Heights
768,horror for Heathcliff’s advances: but he could make nothing of her,Wuthering Heights
768,"evasive replies, and was obliged to close the examination",Wuthering Heights
768,"unsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she were",Wuthering Heights
768,"so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all",Wuthering Heights
768,bonds of relationship between herself and him.,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XII,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and",Wuthering Heights
768,almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books,Wuthering Heights
768,"that he never opened—wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague",Wuthering Heights
768,"expectation that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her",Wuthering Heights
768,"own accord to ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation—and _she_ fasted",Wuthering Heights
768,"pertinaciously, under the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was",Wuthering Heights
768,"ready to choke for her absence, and pride alone held him from running",Wuthering Heights
768,"to cast himself at her feet; I went about my household duties,",Wuthering Heights
768,"convinced that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"that lodged in my body. I wasted no condolences on Miss, nor any",Wuthering Heights
768,expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to the,Wuthering Heights
768,"sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady’s name, since he might",Wuthering Heights
768,not hear her voice. I determined they should come about as they pleased,Wuthering Heights
768,"for me; and though it was a tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice",Wuthering Heights
768,at length in a faint dawn of its progress: as I thought at first.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished",Wuthering Heights
768,"the water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a",Wuthering Heights
768,"basin of gruel, for she believed she was dying. That I set down as a",Wuthering Heights
768,"speech meant for Edgar’s ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it",Wuthering Heights
768,to myself and brought her some tea and dry toast. She ate and drank,Wuthering Heights
768,"eagerly, and sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and",Wuthering Heights
768,"groaning. “Oh, I will die,” she exclaimed, “since no one cares anything",Wuthering Heights
768,about me. I wish I had not taken that.” Then a good while after I heard,Wuthering Heights
768,"her murmur, “No, I’ll not die—he’d be glad—he does not love me at",Wuthering Heights
768,all—he would never miss me!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Did you want anything, ma’am?” I inquired, still preserving my",Wuthering Heights
768,"external composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange,",Wuthering Heights
768,exaggerated manner.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What is that apathetic being doing?” she demanded, pushing the thick",Wuthering Heights
768,"entangled locks from her wasted face. “Has he fallen into a lethargy,",Wuthering Heights
768,or is he dead?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Neither,” replied I; “if you mean Mr. Linton. He’s tolerably well, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"think, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is",Wuthering Heights
768,"continually among his books, since he has no other society.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I",Wuthering Heights
768,could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Among his books!” she cried, confounded. “And I dying! I on the brink",Wuthering Heights
768,"of the grave! My God! does he know how I’m altered?” continued she,",Wuthering Heights
768,staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite,Wuthering Heights
768,"wall. “Is that Catherine Linton? He imagines me in a pet—in play,",Wuthering Heights
768,"perhaps. Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest? Nelly, if",Wuthering Heights
768,"it be not too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I’ll choose",Wuthering Heights
768,between these two: either to starve at once—that would be no punishment,Wuthering Heights
768,"unless he had a heart—or to recover, and leave the country. Are you",Wuthering Heights
768,speaking the truth about him now? Take care. Is he actually so utterly,Wuthering Heights
768,indifferent for my life?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why, ma’am,” I answered, “the master has no idea of your being",Wuthering Heights
768,deranged; and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die,Wuthering Heights
768,of hunger.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“You think not? Cannot you tell him I will?” she returned. “Persuade,Wuthering Heights
768,him! speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,” I suggested, “that you have eaten some",Wuthering Heights
768,"food with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its",Wuthering Heights
768,good effects.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“If I were only sure it would kill him,” she interrupted, “I’d kill",Wuthering Heights
768,myself directly! These three awful nights I’ve never closed my lids—and,Wuthering Heights
768,"oh, I’ve been tormented! I’ve been haunted, Nelly! But I begin to fancy",Wuthering Heights
768,"you don’t like me. How strange! I thought, though everybody hated and",Wuthering Heights
768,"despised each other, they could not avoid loving me. And they have all",Wuthering Heights
768,"turned to enemies in a few hours. _They_ have, I’m positive; the people",Wuthering Heights
768,"_here_. How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!",Wuthering Heights
768,"Isabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be",Wuthering Heights
768,so dreadful to watch Catherine go. And Edgar standing solemnly by to,Wuthering Heights
768,see it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace,Wuthering Heights
768,"to his house, and going back to his _books_! What in the name of all",Wuthering Heights
768,"that feels has he to do with _books_, when I am dying?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton’s philosophical resignation. Tossing about, she increased her",Wuthering Heights
768,"feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth;",Wuthering Heights
768,"then raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the",Wuthering Heights
768,"window. We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the",Wuthering Heights
768,"north-east, and I objected. Both the expressions flitting over her",Wuthering Heights
768,"face, and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"brought to my recollection her former illness, and the doctor’s",Wuthering Heights
768,injunction that she should not be crossed. A minute previously she was,Wuthering Heights
768,"violent; now, supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey",Wuthering Heights
768,"her, she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from",Wuthering Heights
768,"the rents she had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to",Wuthering Heights
768,their different species: her mind had strayed to other associations.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“That’s a turkey’s,” she murmured to herself; “and this is a wild",Wuthering Heights
768,"duck’s; and this is a pigeon’s. Ah, they put pigeons’ feathers in the",Wuthering Heights
768,pillows—no wonder I couldn’t die! Let me take care to throw it on the,Wuthering Heights
768,floor when I lie down. And here is a moor-cock’s; and this—I should,Wuthering Heights
768,know it among a thousand—it’s a lapwing’s. Bonny bird; wheeling over,Wuthering Heights
768,"our heads in the middle of the moor. It wanted to get to its nest, for",Wuthering Heights
768,"the clouds had touched the swells, and it felt rain coming. This",Wuthering Heights
768,"feather was picked up from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its",Wuthering Heights
768,"nest in the winter, full of little skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap",Wuthering Heights
768,"over it, and the old ones dared not come. I made him promise he’d never",Wuthering Heights
768,"shoot a lapwing after that, and he didn’t. Yes, here are more! Did he",Wuthering Heights
768,"shoot my lapwings, Nelly? Are they red, any of them? Let me look.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Give over with that baby-work!” I interrupted, dragging the pillow",Wuthering Heights
768,"away, and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing",Wuthering Heights
768,its contents by handfuls. “Lie down and shut your eyes: you’re,Wuthering Heights
768,wandering. There’s a mess! The down is flying about like snow.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I went here and there collecting it.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I see in you, Nelly,” she continued dreamily, “an aged woman: you have",Wuthering Heights
768,grey hair and bent shoulders. This bed is the fairy cave under,Wuthering Heights
768,"Penistone Crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers;",Wuthering Heights
768,"pretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of wool. That’s",Wuthering Heights
768,what you’ll come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now. I’m,Wuthering Heights
768,"not wandering: you’re mistaken, or else I should believe you really",Wuthering Heights
768,"_were_ that withered hag, and I should think I _was_ under Penistone",Wuthering Heights
768,"Crags; and I’m conscious it’s night, and there are two candles on the",Wuthering Heights
768,table making the black press shine like jet.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“The black press? where is that?” I asked. “You are talking in your,Wuthering Heights
768,sleep!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It’s against the wall, as it always is,” she replied. “It _does_",Wuthering Heights
768,appear odd—I see a face in it!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There’s no press in the room, and never was,” said I, resuming my",Wuthering Heights
768,"seat, and looping up the curtain that I might watch her.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Don’t _you_ see that face?” she inquired, gazing earnestly at the",Wuthering Heights
768,mirror.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be",Wuthering Heights
768,her own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It’s behind there still!” she pursued, anxiously. “And it stirred. Who",Wuthering Heights
768,"is it? I hope it will not come out when you are gone! Oh! Nelly, the",Wuthering Heights
768,room is haunted! I’m afraid of being alone!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of",Wuthering Heights
768,"shudders convulsed her frame, and she _would_ keep straining her gaze",Wuthering Heights
768,towards the glass.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There’s nobody here!” I insisted. “It was _yourself_, Mrs. Linton: you",Wuthering Heights
768,knew it a while since.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Myself!” she gasped, “and the clock is striking twelve! It’s true,",Wuthering Heights
768,then! that’s dreadful!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes. I",Wuthering Heights
768,attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her,Wuthering Heights
768,husband; but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek—the shawl had,Wuthering Heights
768,dropped from the frame.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why, what _is_ the matter?” cried I. “Who is coward now? Wake up! That",Wuthering Heights
768,"is the glass—the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and",Wuthering Heights
768,there am I too by your side.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually",Wuthering Heights
768,passed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of,Wuthering Heights
768,shame.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, dear! I thought I was at home,” she sighed. “I thought I was lying",Wuthering Heights
768,"in my chamber at Wuthering Heights. Because I’m weak, my brain got",Wuthering Heights
768,"confused, and I screamed unconsciously. Don’t say anything; but stay",Wuthering Heights
768,with me. I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“A sound sleep would do you good, ma’am,” I answered: “and I hope this",Wuthering Heights
768,suffering will prevent your trying starving again.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!” she went on",Wuthering Heights
768,"bitterly, wringing her hands. “And that wind sounding in the firs by",Wuthering Heights
768,the lattice. Do let me feel it—it comes straight down the moor—do let,Wuthering Heights
768,me have one breath!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,To pacify her I held the casement ajar a few seconds. A cold blast,Wuthering Heights
768,"rushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post. She lay still",Wuthering Heights
768,"now, her face bathed in tears. Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued",Wuthering Heights
768,her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“How long is it since I shut myself in here?” she asked, suddenly",Wuthering Heights
768,reviving.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It was Monday evening,” I replied, “and this is Thursday night, or",Wuthering Heights
768,"rather Friday morning, at present.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What! of the same week?” she exclaimed. “Only that brief time?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper,”",Wuthering Heights
768,observed I.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, it seems a weary number of hours,” she muttered doubtfully: “it",Wuthering Heights
768,must be more. I remember being in the parlour after they had,Wuthering Heights
768,"quarrelled, and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this",Wuthering Heights
768,"room desperate. As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness",Wuthering Heights
768,"overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor. I couldn’t explain to Edgar",Wuthering Heights
768,"how certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he",Wuthering Heights
768,"persisted in teasing me! I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he",Wuthering Heights
768,"did not guess my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to",Wuthering Heights
768,escape from him and his voice. Before I recovered sufficiently to see,Wuthering Heights
768,"and hear, it began to be dawn, and, Nelly, I’ll tell you what I",Wuthering Heights
768,"thought, and what has kept recurring and recurring till I feared for my",Wuthering Heights
768,"reason. I thought as I lay there, with my head against that table leg,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window, that I was",Wuthering Heights
768,enclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and my heart ached with some,Wuthering Heights
768,"great grief which, just waking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"worried myself to discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the",Wuthering Heights
768,whole last seven years of my life grew a blank! I did not recall that,Wuthering Heights
768,"they had been at all. I was a child; my father was just buried, and my",Wuthering Heights
768,misery arose from the separation that Hindley had ordered between me,Wuthering Heights
768,"and Heathcliff. I was laid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from",Wuthering Heights
768,"a dismal doze after a night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the",Wuthering Heights
768,"panels aside: it struck the table-top! I swept it along the carpet, and",Wuthering Heights
768,then memory burst in: my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of,Wuthering Heights
768,despair. I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretched: it must have been,Wuthering Heights
768,"temporary derangement; for there is scarcely cause. But, supposing at",Wuthering Heights
768,"twelve years old I had been wrenched from the Heights, and every early",Wuthering Heights
768,"association, and my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"been converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross",Wuthering Heights
768,"Grange, and the wife of a stranger: an exile, and outcast, thenceforth,",Wuthering Heights
768,from what had been my world. You may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where,Wuthering Heights
768,"I grovelled! Shake your head as you will, Nelly, _you_ have helped to",Wuthering Heights
768,"unsettle me! You should have spoken to Edgar, indeed you should, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"compelled him to leave me quiet! Oh, I’m burning! I wish I were out of",Wuthering Heights
768,"doors! I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy, and free; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"laughing at injuries, not maddening under them! Why am I so changed?",Wuthering Heights
768,why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words? I’m sure I,Wuthering Heights
768,should be myself were I once among the heather on those hills. Open the,Wuthering Heights
768,"window again wide: fasten it open! Quick, why don’t you move?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Because I won’t give you your death of cold,” I answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You won’t give me a chance of life, you mean,” she said sullenly.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“However, I’m not helpless yet; I’ll open it myself.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the",Wuthering Heights
768,"room, walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless",Wuthering Heights
768,of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"entreated, and finally attempted to force her to retire. But I soon",Wuthering Heights
768,"found her delirious strength much surpassed mine (she _was_ delirious,",Wuthering Heights
768,I became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings). There was no,Wuthering Heights
768,"moon, and everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed",Wuthering Heights
768,"from any house, far or near; all had been extinguished long ago: and",Wuthering Heights
768,those at Wuthering Heights were never visible—still she asserted she,Wuthering Heights
768,caught their shining.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Look!” she cried eagerly, “that’s my room with the candle in it, and",Wuthering Heights
768,the trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph’s,Wuthering Heights
768,"garret. Joseph sits up late, doesn’t he? He’s waiting till I come home",Wuthering Heights
768,"that he may lock the gate. Well, he’ll wait a while yet. It’s a rough",Wuthering Heights
768,"journey, and a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton",Wuthering Heights
768,"Kirk to go that journey! We’ve braved its ghosts often together, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come. But,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, if I dare you now, will you venture? If you do, I’ll keep",Wuthering Heights
768,"you. I’ll not lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and throw the church down over me, but I won’t rest till you are with",Wuthering Heights
768,me. I never will!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She paused, and resumed with a strange smile. “He’s considering—he’d",Wuthering Heights
768,"rather I’d come to him! Find a way, then! not through that kirkyard.",Wuthering Heights
768,"You are slow! Be content, you always followed me!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I",Wuthering Heights
768,"could reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of",Wuthering Heights
768,"herself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when,",Wuthering Heights
768,"to my consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton entered. He had only then come from the library; and, in passing",Wuthering Heights
768,"through the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by",Wuthering Heights
768,"curiosity, or fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, sir!” I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the",Wuthering Heights
768,"sight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber. “My poor",Wuthering Heights
768,"mistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all;",Wuthering Heights
768,"pray, come and persuade her to go to bed. Forget your anger, for she’s",Wuthering Heights
768,hard to guide any way but her own.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Catherine ill?” he said, hastening to us. “Shut the window, Ellen!",Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine! why—”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He was silent. The haggardness of Mrs. Linton’s appearance smote him,Wuthering Heights
768,"speechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified",Wuthering Heights
768,astonishment.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She’s been fretting here,” I continued, “and eating scarcely anything,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and so we couldn’t inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it",Wuthering Heights
768,ourselves; but it is nothing.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned. “It is,Wuthering Heights
768,"nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?” he said sternly. “You shall account more",Wuthering Heights
768,clearly for keeping me ignorant of this!” And he took his wife in his,Wuthering Heights
768,"arms, and looked at her with anguish.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,At first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her,Wuthering Heights
768,"abstracted gaze. The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her",Wuthering Heights
768,"eyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her",Wuthering Heights
768,"attention on him, and discovered who it was that held her.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?” she said, with angry",Wuthering Heights
768,animation. “You are one of those things that are ever found when least,Wuthering Heights
768,"wanted, and when you are wanted, never! I suppose we shall have plenty",Wuthering Heights
768,of lamentations now—I see we shall—but they can’t keep me from my,Wuthering Heights
768,"narrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I’m bound before spring",Wuthering Heights
768,"is over! There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the",Wuthering Heights
768,"chapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please",Wuthering Heights
768,yourself whether you go to them or come to me!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Catherine, what have you done?” commenced the master. “Am I nothing to",Wuthering Heights
768,you any more? Do you love that wretch Heath—”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hush!” cried Mrs. Linton. “Hush, this moment! You mention that name",Wuthering Heights
768,and I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window! What you,Wuthering Heights
768,touch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top,Wuthering Heights
768,"before you lay hands on me again. I don’t want you, Edgar: I’m past",Wuthering Heights
768,"wanting you. Return to your books. I’m glad you possess a consolation,",Wuthering Heights
768,for all you had in me is gone.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Her mind wanders, sir,” I interposed. “She has been talking nonsense",Wuthering Heights
768,"the whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"she’ll rally. Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I desire no further advice from you,” answered Mr. Linton. “You knew",Wuthering Heights
768,"your mistress’s nature, and you encouraged me to harass her. And not to",Wuthering Heights
768,give me one hint of how she has been these three days! It was,Wuthering Heights
768,heartless! Months of sickness could not cause such a change!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for",Wuthering Heights
768,another’s wicked waywardness. “I knew Mrs. Linton’s nature to be,Wuthering Heights
768,"headstrong and domineering,” cried I: “but I didn’t know that you",Wuthering Heights
768,"wished to foster her fierce temper! I didn’t know that, to humour her,",Wuthering Heights
768,I should wink at Mr. Heathcliff. I performed the duty of a faithful,Wuthering Heights
768,"servant in telling you, and I have got a faithful servant’s wages!",Wuthering Heights
768,"Well, it will teach me to be careful next time. Next time you may",Wuthering Heights
768,gather intelligence for yourself!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen",Wuthering Heights
768,"Dean,” he replied.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’d rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?” said",Wuthering Heights
768,"I. “Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to",Wuthering Heights
768,"drop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison",Wuthering Heights
768,the mistress against you?”,Wuthering Heights

768,"Confused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our",Wuthering Heights
768,conversation.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ah! Nelly has played traitor,” she exclaimed, passionately. “Nelly is",Wuthering Heights
768,my hidden enemy. You witch! So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us! Let me,Wuthering Heights
768,"go, and I’ll make her rue! I’ll make her howl a recantation!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,A maniac’s fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately to,Wuthering Heights
768,disengage herself from Linton’s arms. I felt no inclination to tarry,Wuthering Heights
768,"the event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility,",Wuthering Heights
768,I quitted the chamber.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook",Wuthering Heights
768,"is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly,",Wuthering Heights
768,"evidently by another agent than the wind. Notwithstanding my hurry, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"stayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction",Wuthering Heights
768,impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.,Wuthering Heights
768,"My surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more",Wuthering Heights
768,"than vision, Miss Isabella’s springer, Fanny, suspended by a",Wuthering Heights
768,"handkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp. I quickly released the",Wuthering Heights
768,"animal, and lifted it into the garden. I had seen it follow its",Wuthering Heights
768,mistress upstairs when she went to bed; and wondered much how it could,Wuthering Heights
768,"have got out there, and what mischievous person had treated it so.",Wuthering Heights
768,"While untying the knot round the hook, it seemed to me that I",Wuthering Heights
768,repeatedly caught the beat of horses’ feet galloping at some distance;,Wuthering Heights
768,but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I,Wuthering Heights
768,"hardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange sound,",Wuthering Heights
768,"in that place, at two o’clock in the morning.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a,Wuthering Heights
768,patient in the village as I came up the street; and my account of,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine Linton’s malady induced him to accompany me back immediately.,Wuthering Heights
768,He was a plain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of,Wuthering Heights
768,her surviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to,Wuthering Heights
768,his directions than she had shown herself before.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nelly Dean,” said he, “I can’t help fancying there’s an extra cause",Wuthering Heights
768,for this. What has there been to do at the Grange? We’ve odd reports up,Wuthering Heights
768,"here. A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a",Wuthering Heights
768,trifle; and that sort of people should not either. It’s hard work,Wuthering Heights
768,"bringing them through fevers, and such things. How did it begin?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“The master will inform you,” I answered; “but you are acquainted with",Wuthering Heights
768,"the Earnshaws’ violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all. I",Wuthering Heights
768,may say this; it commenced in a quarrel. She was struck during a,Wuthering Heights
768,"tempest of passion with a kind of fit. That’s her account, at least:",Wuthering Heights
768,"for she flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Afterwards, she refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and",Wuthering Heights
768,"remains in a half dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind",Wuthering Heights
768,filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mr. Linton will be sorry?” observed Kenneth, interrogatively.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Sorry? he’ll break his heart should anything happen!” I replied.,Wuthering Heights
768,“Don’t alarm him more than necessary.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, I told him to beware,” said my companion; “and he must bide the",Wuthering Heights
768,consequences of neglecting my warning! Hasn’t he been intimate with Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff lately?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,” answered I, “though more",Wuthering Heights
768,"on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than",Wuthering Heights
768,because the master likes his company. At present he’s discharged from,Wuthering Heights
768,the trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after,Wuthering Heights
768,Miss Linton which he manifested. I hardly think he’ll be taken in,Wuthering Heights
768,again.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?” was the doctor’s,Wuthering Heights
768,next question.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m not in her confidence,” returned I, reluctant to continue the",Wuthering Heights
768,subject.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, she’s a sly one,” he remarked, shaking his head. “She keeps her",Wuthering Heights
768,own counsel! But she’s a real little fool. I have it from good,Wuthering Heights
768,authority that last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and,Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house,Wuthering Heights
768,"above two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but just mount",Wuthering Heights
768,his horse and away with him! My informant said she could only put him,Wuthering Heights
768,off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first,Wuthering Heights
768,meeting after that: when it was to be he didn’t hear; but you urge Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,Linton to look sharp!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran",Wuthering Heights
768,most of the way back. The little dog was yelping in the garden yet. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"spared a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the",Wuthering Heights
768,"house door, it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have",Wuthering Heights
768,"escaped to the road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me. On",Wuthering Heights
768,"ascending to Isabella’s room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was",Wuthering Heights
768,empty. Had I been a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton’s illness might have,Wuthering Heights
768,arrested her rash step. But what could be done now? There was a bare,Wuthering Heights
768,possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly. _I_ could not,Wuthering Heights
768,"pursue them, however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the",Wuthering Heights
768,"place with confusion; still less unfold the business to my master,",Wuthering Heights
768,"absorbed as he was in his present calamity, and having no heart to",Wuthering Heights
768,"spare for a second grief! I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and suffer matters to take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I",Wuthering Heights
768,went with a badly composed countenance to announce him. Catherine lay,Wuthering Heights
768,in a troubled sleep: her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess,Wuthering Heights
768,"of frenzy; he now hung over her pillow, watching every shade and every",Wuthering Heights
768,change of her painfully expressive features.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him",Wuthering Heights
768,"of its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve",Wuthering Heights
768,"around her perfect and constant tranquillity. To me, he signified the",Wuthering Heights
768,"threatening danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of",Wuthering Heights
768,intellect.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we",Wuthering Heights
768,never went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual,Wuthering Heights
768,"hour, moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging",Wuthering Heights
768,whispers as they encountered each other in their vocations. Every one,Wuthering Heights
768,was active but Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she,Wuthering Heights
768,"slept: her brother, too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient",Wuthering Heights
768,"for her presence, and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her",Wuthering Heights
768,sister-in-law. I trembled lest he should send me to call her; but I was,Wuthering Heights
768,spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight. One of,Wuthering Heights
768,"the maids, a thoughtless girl, who had been on an early errand to",Wuthering Heights
768,"Gimmerton, came panting upstairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the",Wuthering Heights
768,"chamber, crying: “Oh, dear, dear! What mun we have next? Master,",Wuthering Heights
768,"master, our young lady—”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hold your noise!” cried I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Speak lower, Mary—What is the matter?” said Mr. Linton. “What ails",Wuthering Heights
768,your young lady?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She’s gone, she’s gone! Yon’ Heathcliff’s run off wi’ her!” gasped the",Wuthering Heights
768,girl.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“That is not true!” exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation. “It cannot",Wuthering Heights
768,"be: how has the idea entered your head? Ellen Dean, go and seek her. It",Wuthering Heights
768,is incredible: it cannot be.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his",Wuthering Heights
768,demand to know her reasons for such an assertion.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,” she stammered,",Wuthering Heights
768,“and he asked whether we weren’t in trouble at the Grange. I thought he,Wuthering Heights
768,"meant for missis’s sickness, so I answered, yes. Then says he, ‘There’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"somebody gone after ’em, I guess?’ I stared. He saw I knew nought about",Wuthering Heights
768,"it, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"shoe fastened at a blacksmith’s shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not",Wuthering Heights
768,very long after midnight! and how the blacksmith’s lass had got up to,Wuthering Heights
768,spy who they were: she knew them both directly. And she noticed the,Wuthering Heights
768,"man—Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob’dy could mistake him,",Wuthering Heights
768,besides—put a sovereign in her father’s hand for payment. The lady had,Wuthering Heights
768,"a cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she",Wuthering Heights
768,"drank it fell back, and she saw her very plain. Heathcliff held both",Wuthering Heights
768,"bridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and",Wuthering Heights
768,went as fast as the rough roads would let them. The lass said nothing,Wuthering Heights
768,"to her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I ran and peeped, for form’s sake, into Isabella’s room; confirming,",Wuthering Heights
768,"when I returned, the servant’s statement. Mr. Linton had resumed his",Wuthering Heights
768,"seat by the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the",Wuthering Heights
768,"meaning of my blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order,",Wuthering Heights
768,or uttering a word.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,” I",Wuthering Heights
768,inquired. “How should we do?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She went of her own accord,” answered the master; “she had a right to",Wuthering Heights
768,go if she pleased. Trouble me no more about her. Hereafter she is only,Wuthering Heights
768,"my sister in name: not because I disown her, but because she has",Wuthering Heights
768,disowned me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,And that was all he said on the subject: he did not make a single inquiry,Wuthering Heights
768,"further, or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"For two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs.",Wuthering Heights
768,Linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was,Wuthering Heights
768,denominated a brain fever. No mother could have nursed an only child,Wuthering Heights
768,"more devotedly than Edgar tended her. Day and night he was watching,",Wuthering Heights
768,and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a,Wuthering Heights
768,"shaken reason could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he",Wuthering Heights
768,saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the,Wuthering Heights
768,"source of constant future anxiety—in fact, that his health and strength",Wuthering Heights
768,were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity—he knew no,Wuthering Heights
768,limits in gratitude and joy when Catherine’s life was declared out of,Wuthering Heights
768,"danger; and hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the",Wuthering Heights
768,"gradual return to bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes",Wuthering Heights
768,with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance,Wuthering Heights
768,"also, and she would soon be entirely her former self.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"following March. Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a",Wuthering Heights
768,"handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of",Wuthering Heights
768,"pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered",Wuthering Heights
768,them eagerly together.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,” she exclaimed. “They",Wuthering Heights
768,"remind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted",Wuthering Heights
768,"snow. Edgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost",Wuthering Heights
768,gone?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“The snow is quite gone down here, darling,” replied her husband; “and",Wuthering Heights
768,I only see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is,Wuthering Heights
768,"blue, and the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim",Wuthering Heights
768,"full. Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you",Wuthering Heights
768,"under this roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the",Wuthering Heights
768,"air blows so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I shall never be there but once more,” said the invalid; “and then",Wuthering Heights
768,"you’ll leave me, and I shall remain for ever. Next spring you’ll long",Wuthering Heights
768,"again to have me under this roof, and you’ll look back and think you",Wuthering Heights
768,were happy to-day.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by",Wuthering Heights
768,"the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the",Wuthering Heights
768,tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding. We,Wuthering Heights
768,"knew she was really better, and, therefore, decided that long",Wuthering Heights
768,"confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency, and it",Wuthering Heights
768,might be partially removed by a change of scene. The master told me to,Wuthering Heights
768,"light a fire in the many-weeks’ deserted parlour, and to set an",Wuthering Heights
768,"easy-chair in the sunshine by the window; and then he brought her down,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected,",Wuthering Heights
768,"revived by the objects round her: which, though familiar, were free",Wuthering Heights
768,from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber. By,Wuthering Heights
768,evening she seemed greatly exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade,Wuthering Heights
768,"her to return to that apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa",Wuthering Heights
768,"for her bed, till another room could be prepared. To obviate the",Wuthering Heights
768,"fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where",Wuthering Heights
768,you lie at present—on the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon,Wuthering Heights
768,"strong enough to move from one to the other, leaning on Edgar’s arm.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Ah, I thought myself, she might recover, so waited on as she was. And",Wuthering Heights
768,"there was double cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that",Wuthering Heights
768,of another: we cherished the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton’s,Wuthering Heights
768,"heart would be gladdened, and his lands secured from a stranger’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"gripe, by the birth of an heir.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from",Wuthering Heights
768,"her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff.",Wuthering Heights
768,It appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil,Wuthering Heights
768,"an obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and",Wuthering Heights
768,"reconciliation, if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she",Wuthering Heights
768,"could not help it then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal",Wuthering Heights
768,"it. Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more,",Wuthering Heights
768,"I got a long letter, which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone. I want to ask you,Wuthering Heights
768,"two questions: the first is,—How did you contrive to preserve the",Wuthering Heights
768,common sympathies of human nature when you resided here? I cannot,Wuthering Heights
768,recognise any sentiment which those around share with me.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The second question I have great interest in; it is this—Is Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff a man? If so, is he mad? And if not, is he a devil? I",Wuthering Heights
768,sha’n’t tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to,Wuthering Heights
768,"explain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see",Wuthering Heights
768,"me; and you must call, Ellen, very soon. Don’t write, but come, and",Wuthering Heights
768,bring me something from Edgar.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am",Wuthering Heights
768,led to imagine the Heights will be. It is to amuse myself that I dwell,Wuthering Heights
768,on such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my,Wuthering Heights
768,"thoughts, except at the moment when I miss them. I should laugh and",Wuthering Heights
768,"dance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries,",Wuthering Heights
768,and the rest was an unnatural dream!,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"judged it to be six o’clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to",Wuthering Heights
768,"inspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as",Wuthering Heights
768,well as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard,Wuthering Heights
768,"of the farmhouse, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to",Wuthering Heights
768,receive us by the light of a dip candle. He did it with a courtesy that,Wuthering Heights
768,redounded to his credit. His first act was to elevate his torch to a,Wuthering Heights
768,"level with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn",Wuthering Heights
768,"away. Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables;",Wuthering Heights
768,"reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived",Wuthering Heights
768,in an ancient castle.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen—a dingy,",Wuthering Heights
768,"untidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it",Wuthering Heights
768,"was in your charge. By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb",Wuthering Heights
768,"and dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his",Wuthering Heights
768,mouth.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“This is Edgar’s legal nephew,” I reflected—“mine in a manner; I must",Wuthering Heights
768,"shake hands, and—yes—I must kiss him. It is right to establish a good",Wuthering Heights
768,understanding at the beginning.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said—“How do you",Wuthering Heights
768,"do, my dear?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?” was my next essay at",Wuthering Heights
768,conversation.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"An oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not “frame off”",Wuthering Heights
768,rewarded my perseverance.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hey, Throttler, lad!” whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred",Wuthering Heights
768,"bull-dog from its lair in a corner. “Now, wilt thou be ganging?” he",Wuthering Heights
768,asked authoritatively.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Love for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to,Wuthering Heights
768,wait till the others should enter. Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible;,Wuthering Heights
768,"and Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany",Wuthering Heights
768,"me in, after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and",Wuthering Heights
768,replied—“Mim! mim! mim! Did iver Christian body hear aught like it?,Wuthering Heights
768,Mincing un’ munching! How can I tell whet ye say?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!” I cried, thinking",Wuthering Heights
768,"him deaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“None o’ me! I getten summut else to do,” he answered, and continued",Wuthering Heights
768,"his work; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and",Wuthering Heights
768,"countenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I’m",Wuthering Heights
768,"sure, as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at",Wuthering Heights
768,"which I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant",Wuthering Heights
768,"might show himself. After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall,",Wuthering Heights
768,"gaunt man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his",Wuthering Heights
768,features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders;,Wuthering Heights
768,"and _his_ eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine’s with all their",Wuthering Heights
768,beauty annihilated.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What’s your business here?” he demanded, grimly. “Who are you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“My name _was_ Isabella Linton,” I replied. “You’ve seen me before,",Wuthering Heights
768,"sir. I’m lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here—I",Wuthering Heights
768,suppose by your permission.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is he come back, then?” asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes—we came just now,” I said; “but he left me by the kitchen door;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and when I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the",Wuthering Heights
768,"place, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“It’s well the hellish villain has kept his word!” growled my future,Wuthering Heights
768,"host, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and",Wuthering Heights
768,threats of what he would have done had the “fiend” deceived him.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined",Wuthering Heights
768,"to slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that",Wuthering Heights
768,"intention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door. There",Wuthering Heights
768,"was a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment,",Wuthering Heights
768,whose floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant,Wuthering Heights
768,"pewter-dishes, which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook",Wuthering Heights
768,"of a similar obscurity, created by tarnish and dust. I inquired whether",Wuthering Heights
768,"I might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom! Mr. Earnshaw",Wuthering Heights
768,"vouchsafed no answer. He walked up and down, with his hands in his",Wuthering Heights
768,"pockets, apparently quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction",Wuthering Heights
768,"was evidently so deep, and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I",Wuthering Heights
768,shrank from disturbing him again.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"You’ll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless,",Wuthering Heights
768,"seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing",Wuthering Heights
768,the only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the,Wuthering Heights
768,"Atlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass",Wuthering Heights
768,them! I questioned with myself—where must I turn for comfort? and—mind,Wuthering Heights
768,"you don’t tell Edgar, or Catherine—above every sorrow beside, this rose",Wuthering Heights
768,pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally,Wuthering Heights
768,"against Heathcliff! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost",Wuthering Heights
768,"gladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone",Wuthering Heights
768,"with him; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not",Wuthering Heights
768,fear their intermeddling.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"still my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"perfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself",Wuthering Heights
768,"out at intervals. I listened to detect a woman’s voice in the house,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations,",Wuthering Heights
768,"which, at last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"was not aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in",Wuthering Heights
768,"his measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Taking advantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed—“I’m tired",Wuthering Heights
768,"with my journey, and I want to go to bed! Where is the maid-servant?",Wuthering Heights
768,"Direct me to her, as she won’t come to me!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“We have none,” he answered; “you must wait on yourself!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Where must I sleep, then?” I sobbed; I was beyond regarding",Wuthering Heights
768,"self-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Joseph will show you Heathcliff’s chamber,” said he; “open that",Wuthering Heights
768,door—he’s in there.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the",Wuthering Heights
768,"strangest tone—“Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your",Wuthering Heights
768,bolt—don’t omit it!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well!” I said. “But why, Mr. Earnshaw?” I did not relish the notion of",Wuthering Heights
768,deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Look here!” he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a",Wuthering Heights
768,"curiously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife",Wuthering Heights
768,"attached to the barrel. “That’s a great tempter to a desperate man, is",Wuthering Heights
768,"it not? I cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his",Wuthering Heights
768,"door. If once I find it open he’s done for; I do it invariably, even",Wuthering Heights
768,though the minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that,Wuthering Heights
768,should make me refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own,Wuthering Heights
768,schemes by killing him. You fight against that devil for love as long,Wuthering Heights
768,"as you may; when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall",Wuthering Heights
768,save him!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I surveyed the weapon inquisitively. A hideous notion struck me: how,Wuthering Heights
768,powerful I should be possessing such an instrument! I took it from his,Wuthering Heights
768,"hand, and touched the blade. He looked astonished at the expression my",Wuthering Heights
768,"face assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was",Wuthering Heights
768,"covetousness. He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife,",Wuthering Heights
768,and returned it to its concealment.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I don’t care if you tell him,” said he. “Put him on his guard, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"watch for him. You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not",Wuthering Heights
768,shock you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What has Heathcliff done to you?” I asked. “In what has he wronged,Wuthering Heights
768,"you, to warrant this appalling hatred? Wouldn’t it be wiser to bid him",Wuthering Heights
768,quit the house?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No!” thundered Earnshaw; “should he offer to leave me, he’s a dead",Wuthering Heights
768,"man: persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess! Am I to lose",Wuthering Heights
768,"_all_, without a chance of retrieval? Is Hareton to be a beggar? Oh,",Wuthering Heights
768,damnation! I _will_ have it back; and I’ll have _his_ gold too; and,Wuthering Heights
768,then his blood; and hell shall have his soul! It will be ten times,Wuthering Heights
768,blacker with that guest than ever it was before!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"You’ve acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master’s habits. He is",Wuthering Heights
768,clearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"shuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant’s ill-bred",Wuthering Heights
768,moroseness as comparatively agreeable. He now recommenced his moody,Wuthering Heights
768,"walk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen. Joseph was",Wuthering Heights
768,"bending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it;",Wuthering Heights
768,and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by. The contents,Wuthering Heights
768,"of the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the",Wuthering Heights
768,"bowl; I conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and, being hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out",Wuthering Heights
768,"sharply, “_I’ll_ make the porridge!” I removed the vessel out of his",Wuthering Heights
768,"reach, and proceeded to take off my hat and riding-habit. “Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Earnshaw,” I continued, “directs me to wait on myself: I will. I’m not",Wuthering Heights
768,"going to act the lady among you, for fear I should starve.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Gooid Lord!” he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed",Wuthering Heights
768,stockings from the knee to the ankle. “If there’s to be fresh,Wuthering Heights
768,"ortherings—just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev’ a",Wuthering Heights
768,"_mistress_ set o’er my heead, it’s like time to be flitting. I niver",Wuthering Heights
768,_did_ think to see t’ day that I mud lave th’ owld place—but I doubt,Wuthering Heights
768,it’s nigh at hand!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work,",Wuthering Heights
768,sighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but,Wuthering Heights
768,compelled speedily to drive off the remembrance. It racked me to recall,Wuthering Heights
768,past happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its,Wuthering Heights
768,"apparition, the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the",Wuthering Heights
768,handfuls of meal fell into the water. Joseph beheld my style of cookery,Wuthering Heights
768,with growing indignation.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Thear!” he ejaculated. “Hareton, thou willn’t sup thy porridge",Wuthering Heights
768,"to-neeght; they’ll be naught but lumps as big as my neive. Thear,",Wuthering Heights
768,"agean! I’d fling in bowl un’ all, if I wer ye! There, pale t’ guilp",Wuthering Heights
768,"off, un’ then ye’ll hae done wi’t. Bang, bang. It’s a mercy t’ bothom",Wuthering Heights
768,isn’t deaved out!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"It _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four",Wuthering Heights
768,"had been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from",Wuthering Heights
768,"the dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling",Wuthering Heights
768,"from the expansive lip. I expostulated, and desired that he should have",Wuthering Heights
768,his in a mug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so,Wuthering Heights
768,dirtily. The old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety;,Wuthering Heights
768,"assuring me, repeatedly, that “the barn was every bit as good” as I,",Wuthering Heights
768,"“and every bit as wollsome,” and wondering how I could fashion to be so",Wuthering Heights
768,"conceited. Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"glowered up at me defyingly, as he slavered into the jug.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I shall have my supper in another room,” I said. “Have you no place",Wuthering Heights
768,you call a parlour?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“_Parlour_!” he echoed, sneeringly, “_parlour_! Nay, we’ve noa",Wuthering Heights
768,"_parlours_. If yah dunnut loike wer company, there’s maister’s; un’ if",Wuthering Heights
768,"yah dunnut loike maister, there’s us.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Then I shall go upstairs,” I answered; “show me a chamber.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk. With",Wuthering Heights
768,"great grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we",Wuthering Heights
768,"mounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into",Wuthering Heights
768,the apartments we passed.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Here’s a rahm,” he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on",Wuthering Heights
768,hinges. “It’s weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in. There’s a pack o’,Wuthering Heights
768,"corn i’ t’ corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye’re feared o’ muckying",Wuthering Heights
768,"yer grand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o’ t’ top on’t.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The “rahm” was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain;,Wuthering Heights
768,"various sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare",Wuthering Heights
768,space in the middle.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why, man,” I exclaimed, facing him angrily, “this is not a place to",Wuthering Heights
768,sleep in. I wish to see my bed-room.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“_Bed-rume_!” he repeated, in a tone of mockery. “Yah’s see all t’",Wuthering Heights
768,_bed-rumes_ thear is—yon’s mine.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in",Wuthering Heights
768,"being more naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless",Wuthering Heights
768,"bed, with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What do I want with yours?” I retorted. “I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does,Wuthering Heights
768,"not lodge at the top of the house, does he?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh! it’s Maister _Hathecliff’s_ ye’re wanting?” cried he, as if making",Wuthering Heights
768,"a new discovery. “Couldn’t ye ha’ said soa, at onst? un’ then, I mud",Wuthering Heights
768,"ha’ telled ye, baht all this wark, that that’s just one ye cannut",Wuthering Heights
768,"see—he allas keeps it locked, un’ nob’dy iver mells on’t but hisseln.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’ve a nice house, Joseph,” I could not refrain from observing, “and",Wuthering Heights
768,pleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the,Wuthering Heights
768,madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my,Wuthering Heights
768,"fate with theirs! However, that is not to the present purpose—there are",Wuthering Heights
768,"other rooms. For heaven’s sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the,Wuthering Heights
768,"wooden steps, and halting before an apartment which, from that halt",Wuthering Heights
768,"and the superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best",Wuthering Heights
768,"one. There was a carpet—a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by",Wuthering Heights
768,"dust; a fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome",Wuthering Heights
768,oak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material,Wuthering Heights
768,and modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the,Wuthering Heights
768,"vallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod",Wuthering Heights
768,"supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to",Wuthering Heights
768,"trail upon the floor. The chairs were also damaged, many of them",Wuthering Heights
768,severely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls. I was,Wuthering Heights
768,"endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession,",Wuthering Heights
768,"when my fool of a guide announced,—“This here is t’ maister’s.” My",Wuthering Heights
768,"supper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience",Wuthering Heights
768,exhausted. I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of,Wuthering Heights
768,"refuge, and means of repose.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Whear the divil?” began the religious elder. “The Lord bless us! The,Wuthering Heights
768,"Lord forgie us! Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang? ye marred, wearisome",Wuthering Heights
768,nowt! Ye’ve seen all but Hareton’s bit of a cham’er. There’s not,Wuthering Heights
768,another hoile to lig down in i’ th’ hahse!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"then seated myself at the stairs’-head, hid my face in my hands, and",Wuthering Heights
768,cried.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ech! ech!” exclaimed Joseph. “Weel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss",Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy! Howsiver, t’ maister sall just tum’le o’er them brocken pots;",Wuthering Heights
768,un’ then we’s hear summut; we’s hear how it’s to be. Gooid-for-naught,Wuthering Heights
768,"madling! ye desarve pining fro’ this to Churstmas, flinging t’ precious",Wuthering Heights
768,gifts uh God under fooit i’ yer flaysome rages! But I’m mista’en if ye,Wuthering Heights
768,"shew yer sperrit lang. Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye?",Wuthering Heights
768,I nobbut wish he may catch ye i’ that plisky. I nobbut wish he may.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"And so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with",Wuthering Heights
768,him; and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection succeeding,Wuthering Heights
768,this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my,Wuthering Heights
768,"pride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its",Wuthering Heights
768,effects. An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of,Wuthering Heights
768,"Throttler, whom I now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had",Wuthering Heights
768,"spent its whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,Hindley. I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of,Wuthering Heights
768,"salute, and then hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from",Wuthering Heights
768,"step to step, collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the",Wuthering Heights
768,spatters of milk from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our,Wuthering Heights
768,labours were scarcely over when I heard Earnshaw’s tread in the,Wuthering Heights
768,"passage; my assistant tucked in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I",Wuthering Heights
768,stole into the nearest doorway. The dog’s endeavour to avoid him was,Wuthering Heights
768,"unsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter downstairs, and a prolonged,",Wuthering Heights
768,"piteous yelping. I had better luck: he passed on, entered his chamber,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and shut the door. Directly after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put",Wuthering Heights
768,"him to bed. I had found shelter in Hareton’s room, and the old man, on",Wuthering Heights
768,"seeing me, said,—“They’s rahm for boath ye un’ yer pride, now, I sud",Wuthering Heights
768,"think i’ the hahse. It’s empty; ye may hev’ it all to yerseln, un’ Him",Wuthering Heights
768,"as allas maks a third, i’ sich ill company!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung,Wuthering Heights
768,"myself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept. My slumber was",Wuthering Heights
768,"deep and sweet, though over far too soon. Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he",Wuthering Heights
768,"had just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing",Wuthering Heights
768,there? I told him the cause of my staying up so late—that he had the,Wuthering Heights
768,key of our room in his pocket. The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.,Wuthering Heights
768,"He swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he’d—but I’ll not",Wuthering Heights
768,"repeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious",Wuthering Heights
768,and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence! I sometimes wonder at,Wuthering Heights
768,"him with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger",Wuthering Heights
768,or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which,Wuthering Heights
768,"he wakens. He told me of Catherine’s illness, and accused my brother of",Wuthering Heights
768,"causing it; promising that I should be Edgar’s proxy in suffering, till",Wuthering Heights
768,he could get hold of him.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I do hate him—I am wretched—I have been a fool! Beware of uttering one,Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"As soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"informed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a",Wuthering Heights
768,"letter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton’s situation, and her",Wuthering Heights
768,"ardent desire to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as",Wuthering Heights
768,"early as possible, some token of forgiveness by me.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Forgiveness!” said Linton. “I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen. You",Wuthering Heights
768,"may call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that",Wuthering Heights
768,"I am not _angry_, but I’m _sorry_ to have lost her; especially as I can",Wuthering Heights
768,never think she’ll be happy. It is out of the question my going to see,Wuthering Heights
768,"her, however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to",Wuthering Heights
768,"oblige me, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the",Wuthering Heights
768,country.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And you won’t write her a little note, sir?” I asked, imploringly.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” he answered. “It is needless. My communication with Heathcliff’s",Wuthering Heights
768,family shall be as sparing as his with mine. It shall not exist!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Edgar’s coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the,Wuthering Heights
768,"Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said,",Wuthering Heights
768,when I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines,Wuthering Heights
768,to console Isabella. I daresay she had been on the watch for me since,Wuthering Heights
768,morning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden,Wuthering Heights
768,"causeway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being",Wuthering Heights
768,"observed. I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary,",Wuthering Heights
768,"dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented! I must confess,",Wuthering Heights
768,"that if I had been in the young lady’s place, I would, at least, have",Wuthering Heights
768,"swept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster. But she already",Wuthering Heights
768,partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her. Her,Wuthering Heights
768,pretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging,Wuthering Heights
768,"lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head. Probably she",Wuthering Heights
768,had not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his",Wuthering Heights
768,"pocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite",Wuthering Heights
768,"friendly, and offered me a chair. He was the only thing there that",Wuthering Heights
768,seemed decent; and I thought he never looked better. So much had,Wuthering Heights
768,"circumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have",Wuthering Heights
768,struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a,Wuthering Heights
768,"thorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and",Wuthering Heights
768,held out one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She,Wuthering Heights
768,"wouldn’t understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I",Wuthering Heights
768,"went to lay my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her",Wuthering Heights
768,directly what I had brought. Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her,Wuthering Heights
768,"manœuvres, and said—“If you have got anything for Isabella (as no",Wuthering Heights
768,"doubt you have, Nelly), give it to her. You needn’t make a secret of",Wuthering Heights
768,it: we have no secrets between us.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, I have nothing,” I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at",Wuthering Heights
768,once. “My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either,Wuthering Heights
768,"a letter or a visit from him at present. He sends his love, ma’am, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"his wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have",Wuthering Heights
768,occasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the,Wuthering Heights
768,"household here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of",Wuthering Heights
768,keeping it up.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mrs. Heathcliff’s lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat",Wuthering Heights
768,"in the window. Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me,",Wuthering Heights
768,and began to put questions concerning Catherine. I told him as much as,Wuthering Heights
768,"I thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by",Wuthering Heights
768,"cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended",Wuthering Heights
768,by hoping that he would follow Mr. Linton’s example and avoid future,Wuthering Heights
768,"interference with his family, for good or evil.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,” I said; “she’ll never be like she",Wuthering Heights
768,"was, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her,",Wuthering Heights
768,"you’ll shun crossing her way again: nay, you’ll move out of this",Wuthering Heights
768,"country entirely; and that you may not regret it, I’ll inform you",Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine,Wuthering Heights
768,"Earnshaw, as that young lady is different from me. Her appearance is",Wuthering Heights
768,"changed greatly, her character much more so; and the person who is",Wuthering Heights
768,"compelled, of necessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his",Wuthering Heights
768,"affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was, by common",Wuthering Heights
768,"humanity, and a sense of duty!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“That is quite possible,” remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem",Wuthering Heights
768,calm: “quite possible that your master should have nothing but common,Wuthering Heights
768,humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon. But do you imagine that,Wuthering Heights
768,I shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_? and can you,Wuthering Heights
768,compare my feelings respecting Catherine to his? Before you leave this,Wuthering Heights
768,"house, I must exact a promise from you that you’ll get me an interview",Wuthering Heights
768,"with her: consent, or refuse, I _will_ see her! What do you say?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I say, Mr. Heathcliff,” I replied, “you must not: you never shall,",Wuthering Heights
768,through my means. Another encounter between you and the master would,Wuthering Heights
768,kill her altogether.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“With your aid that may be avoided,” he continued; “and should there be",Wuthering Heights
768,danger of such an event—should he be the cause of adding a single,Wuthering Heights
768,"trouble more to her existence—why, I think I shall be justified in",Wuthering Heights
768,going to extremes! I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would,Wuthering Heights
768,restrains me. And there you see the distinction between our feelings:,Wuthering Heights
768,"had he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred",Wuthering Heights
768,"that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against",Wuthering Heights
768,"him. You may look incredulous, if you please! I never would have",Wuthering Heights
768,banished him from her society as long as she desired his. The moment,Wuthering Heights
768,"her regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his",Wuthering Heights
768,"blood! But, till then—if you don’t believe me, you don’t know me—till",Wuthering Heights
768,"then, I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his",Wuthering Heights
768,head!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And yet,” I interrupted, “you have no scruples in completely ruining",Wuthering Heights
768,"all hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her",Wuthering Heights
768,"remembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her",Wuthering Heights
768,in a new tumult of discord and distress.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?” he said. “Oh, Nelly! you",Wuthering Heights
768,"know she has not! You know as well as I do, that for every thought she",Wuthering Heights
768,spends on Linton she spends a thousand on me! At a most miserable,Wuthering Heights
768,"period of my life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my",Wuthering Heights
768,return to the neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance,Wuthering Heights
768,"could make me admit the horrible idea again. And then, Linton would be",Wuthering Heights
768,"nothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt. Two words",Wuthering Heights
768,"would comprehend my future—_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing",Wuthering Heights
768,"her, would be hell. Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she",Wuthering Heights
768,valued Edgar Linton’s attachment more than mine. If he loved with all,Wuthering Heights
768,"the powers of his puny being, he couldn’t love as much in eighty years",Wuthering Heights
768,as I could in a day. And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the,Wuthering Heights
768,sea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole,Wuthering Heights
768,affection be monopolised by him. Tush! He is scarcely a degree dearer,Wuthering Heights
768,"to her than her dog, or her horse. It is not in him to be loved like",Wuthering Heights
768,me: how can she love in him what he has not?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can,Wuthering Heights
768,"be,” cried Isabella, with sudden vivacity. “No one has a right to talk",Wuthering Heights
768,"in that manner, and I won’t hear my brother depreciated in silence!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn’t he?” observed",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, scornfully. “He turns you adrift on the world with",Wuthering Heights
768,surprising alacrity.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He is not aware of what I suffer,” she replied. “I didn’t tell him",Wuthering Heights
768,that.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You have been telling him something, then: you have written, have",Wuthering Heights
768,you?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“To say that I was married, I did write—you saw the note.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And nothing since?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“No.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition,”",Wuthering Heights
768,"I remarked. “Somebody’s love comes short in her case, obviously; whose,",Wuthering Heights
768,"I may guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn’t say.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I should guess it was her own,” said Heathcliff. “She degenerates into",Wuthering Heights
768,a mere slut! She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.,Wuthering Heights
768,"You’d hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was",Wuthering Heights
768,"weeping to go home. However, she’ll suit this house so much the better",Wuthering Heights
768,"for not being over nice, and I’ll take care she does not disgrace me by",Wuthering Heights
768,rambling abroad.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, sir,” returned I, “I hope you’ll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff",Wuthering Heights
768,is accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been,Wuthering Heights
768,"brought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.",Wuthering Heights
768,"You must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you",Wuthering Heights
768,"must treat her kindly. Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot",Wuthering Heights
768,"doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn’t",Wuthering Heights
768,"have abandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former",Wuthering Heights
768,"home, to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She abandoned them under a delusion,” he answered; “picturing in me a",Wuthering Heights
768,"hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous",Wuthering Heights
768,"devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature,",Wuthering Heights
768,so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my,Wuthering Heights
768,"character and acting on the false impressions she cherished. But, at",Wuthering Heights
768,"last, I think she begins to know me: I don’t perceive the silly smiles",Wuthering Heights
768,and grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability,Wuthering Heights
768,of discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her,Wuthering Heights
768,infatuation and herself. It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to,Wuthering Heights
768,"discover that I did not love her. I believed, at one time, no lessons",Wuthering Heights
768,could teach her that! And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she,Wuthering Heights
768,"announced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually",Wuthering Heights
768,"succeeded in making her hate me! A positive labour of Hercules, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"assure you! If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks. Can I",Wuthering Heights
768,"trust your assertion, Isabella? Are you sure you hate me? If I let you",Wuthering Heights
768,"alone for half a day, won’t you come sighing and wheedling to me again?",Wuthering Heights
768,I daresay she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it,Wuthering Heights
768,wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed. But I don’t care who knows,Wuthering Heights
768,that the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie,Wuthering Heights
768,about it. She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful,Wuthering Heights
768,"softness. The first thing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange,",Wuthering Heights
768,"was to hang up her little dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first",Wuthering Heights
768,words I uttered were a wish that I had the hanging of every being,Wuthering Heights
768,"belonging to her, except one: possibly she took that exception for",Wuthering Heights
768,herself. But no brutality disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate,Wuthering Heights
768,"admiration of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury!",Wuthering Heights
768,"Now, was it not the depth of absurdity—of genuine idiocy, for that",Wuthering Heights
768,"pitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her?",Wuthering Heights
768,"Tell your master, Nelly, that I never, in all my life, met with such an",Wuthering Heights
768,abject thing as she is. She even disgraces the name of Linton; and I’ve,Wuthering Heights
768,"sometimes relented, from pure lack of invention, in my experiments on",Wuthering Heights
768,"what she could endure, and still creep shamefully cringing back! But",Wuthering Heights
768,"tell him, also, to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease:",Wuthering Heights
768,"that I keep strictly within the limits of the law. I have avoided, up",Wuthering Heights
768,"to this period, giving her the slightest right to claim a separation;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and, what’s more, she’d thank nobody for dividing us. If she desired to",Wuthering Heights
768,"go, she might: the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification",Wuthering Heights
768,to be derived from tormenting her!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mr. Heathcliff,” said I, “this is the talk of a madman; your wife,",Wuthering Heights
768,"most likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has",Wuthering Heights
768,"borne with you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she’ll",Wuthering Heights
768,"doubtless avail herself of the permission. You are not so bewitched,",Wuthering Heights
768,"ma’am, are you, as to remain with him of your own accord?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Take care, Ellen!” answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully;",Wuthering Heights
768,there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her,Wuthering Heights
768,partner’s endeavours to make himself detested. “Don’t put faith in a,Wuthering Heights
768,"single word he speaks. He’s a lying fiend! a monster, and not a human",Wuthering Heights
768,being! I’ve been told I might leave him before; and I’ve made the,Wuthering Heights
768,"attempt, but I dare not repeat it! Only, Ellen, promise you’ll not",Wuthering Heights
768,mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or,Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine. Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to",Wuthering Heights
768,desperation: he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over,Wuthering Heights
768,"him; and he sha’n’t obtain it—I’ll die first! I just hope, I pray, that",Wuthering Heights
768,he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me! The single pleasure,Wuthering Heights
768,"I can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“There—that will do for the present!” said Heathcliff. “If you are,Wuthering Heights
768,"called upon in a court of law, you’ll remember her language, Nelly! And",Wuthering Heights
768,take a good look at that countenance: she’s near the point which would,Wuthering Heights
768,"suit me. No; you’re not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"I, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however",Wuthering Heights
768,distasteful the obligation may be. Go upstairs; I have something to say,Wuthering Heights
768,"to Ellen Dean in private. That’s not the way: upstairs, I tell you!",Wuthering Heights
768,"Why, this is the road upstairs, child!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering—“I have",Wuthering Heights
768,"no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to",Wuthering Heights
768,crush out their entrails! It is a moral teething; and I grind with,Wuthering Heights
768,greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Do you understand what the word pity means?” I said, hastening to",Wuthering Heights
768,resume my bonnet. “Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Put that down!” he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“You are not going yet. Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or",Wuthering Heights
768,"compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine,",Wuthering Heights
768,and that without delay. I swear that I meditate no harm: I don’t desire,Wuthering Heights
768,"to cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only",Wuthering Heights
768,"wish to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to",Wuthering Heights
768,ask if anything that I could do would be of use to her. Last night I,Wuthering Heights
768,"was in the Grange garden six hours, and I’ll return there to-night; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"every night I’ll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an",Wuthering Heights
768,"opportunity of entering. If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate",Wuthering Heights
768,"to knock him down, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while I",Wuthering Heights
768,"stay. If his servants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these",Wuthering Heights
768,pistols. But wouldn’t it be better to prevent my coming in contact with,Wuthering Heights
768,"them, or their master? And you could do it so easily. I’d warn you when",Wuthering Heights
768,"I came, and then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was",Wuthering Heights
768,"alone, and watch till I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would",Wuthering Heights
768,be hindering mischief.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer’s,Wuthering Heights
768,"house: and, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his",Wuthering Heights
768,destroying Mrs. Linton’s tranquillity for his satisfaction. “The,Wuthering Heights
768,"commonest occurrence startles her painfully,” I said. “She’s all",Wuthering Heights
768,"nerves, and she couldn’t bear the surprise, I’m positive. Don’t",Wuthering Heights
768,"persist, sir! or else I shall be obliged to inform my master of your",Wuthering Heights
768,designs; and he’ll take measures to secure his house and its inmates,Wuthering Heights
768,from any such unwarrantable intrusions!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“In that case I’ll take measures to secure you, woman!” exclaimed",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff; “you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow,Wuthering Heights
768,morning. It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear,Wuthering Heights
768,"to see me; and as to surprising her, I don’t desire it: you must",Wuthering Heights
768,"prepare her—ask her if I may come. You say she never mentions my name,",Wuthering Heights
768,and that I am never mentioned to her. To whom should she mention me if,Wuthering Heights
768,I am a forbidden topic in the house? She thinks you are all spies for,Wuthering Heights
768,"her husband. Oh, I’ve no doubt she’s in hell among you! I guess by her",Wuthering Heights
768,"silence, as much as anything, what she feels. You say she is often",Wuthering Heights
768,"restless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity? You",Wuthering Heights
768,talk of her mind being unsettled. How the devil could it be otherwise,Wuthering Heights
768,"in her frightful isolation? And that insipid, paltry creature attending",Wuthering Heights
768,her from _duty_ and _humanity_! From _pity_ and _charity_! He might as,Wuthering Heights
768,"well plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine",Wuthering Heights
768,he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares! Let us,Wuthering Heights
768,"settle it at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to",Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine over Linton and his footman? Or will you be my friend, as you",Wuthering Heights
768,"have been hitherto, and do what I request? Decide! because there is no",Wuthering Heights
768,"reason for my lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn",Wuthering Heights
768,ill-nature!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him",Wuthering Heights
768,fifty times; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement. I,Wuthering Heights
768,engaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she,Wuthering Heights
768,"consent, I promised to let him have intelligence of Linton’s next",Wuthering Heights
768,"absence from home, when he might come, and get in as he was able: I",Wuthering Heights
768,"wouldn’t be there, and my fellow-servants should be equally out of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"way. Was it right or wrong? I fear it was wrong, though expedient. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"thought I prevented another explosion by my compliance; and I thought,",Wuthering Heights
768,"too, it might create a favourable crisis in Catherine’s mental illness:",Wuthering Heights
768,and then I remembered Mr. Edgar’s stern rebuke of my carrying tales;,Wuthering Heights

768,"affirming, with frequent iteration, that that betrayal of trust, if it",Wuthering Heights

768,"Another week over—and I am so many days nearer health, and spring! I",Wuthering Heights
768,"have now heard all my neighbour’s history, at different sittings, as",Wuthering Heights
768,the housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations. I’ll,Wuthering Heights
768,"continue it in her own words, only a little condensed. She is, on the",Wuthering Heights

768,"In the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"knew, as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and I shunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my",Wuthering Heights
768,"pocket, and didn’t want to be threatened or teased any more. I had made",Wuthering Heights
768,"up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not",Wuthering Heights
768,"guess how its receipt would affect Catherine. The consequence was, that",Wuthering Heights
768,it did not reach her before the lapse of three days. The fourth was,Wuthering Heights
768,"Sunday, and I brought it into her room after the family were gone to",Wuthering Heights
768,"church. There was a man servant left to keep the house with me, and we",Wuthering Heights
768,generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of,Wuthering Heights
768,service; but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that,Wuthering Heights
768,"I set them wide open, and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would",Wuthering Heights
768,"be coming, I told my companion that the mistress wished very much for",Wuthering Heights
768,"some oranges, and he must run over to the village and get a few, to be",Wuthering Heights
768,"paid for on the morrow. He departed, and I went upstairs.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her",Wuthering Heights
768,"shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual. Her thick, long",Wuthering Heights
768,"hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now",Wuthering Heights
768,she wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and,Wuthering Heights
768,"neck. Her appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when",Wuthering Heights
768,"she was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change. The flash of",Wuthering Heights
768,her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they,Wuthering Heights
768,no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her:,Wuthering Heights
768,"they appeared always to gaze beyond, and far beyond—you would have said",Wuthering Heights
768,"out of this world. Then, the paleness of her face—its haggard aspect",Wuthering Heights
768,having vanished as she recovered flesh—and the peculiar expression,Wuthering Heights
768,"arising from her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their",Wuthering Heights
768,"causes, added to the touching interest which she awakened;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and—invariably to me, I know, and to any person who saw her, I should",Wuthering Heights
768,"think—refuted more tangible proofs of convalescence, and stamped her as",Wuthering Heights
768,one doomed to decay.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible",Wuthering Heights
768,wind fluttered its leaves at intervals. I believe Linton had laid it,Wuthering Heights
768,"there: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or",Wuthering Heights
768,"occupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to",Wuthering Heights
768,entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her,Wuthering Heights
768,"amusement. She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods",Wuthering Heights
768,"endured his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and",Wuthering Heights
768,"then suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the",Wuthering Heights
768,"saddest of smiles and kisses. At other times, she would turn petulantly",Wuthering Heights
768,"away, and hide her face in her hands, or even push him off angrily; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"then he took care to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no",Wuthering Heights
768,good.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of",Wuthering Heights
768,the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear. It was a sweet,Wuthering Heights
768,"substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which",Wuthering Heights
768,drowned that music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf. At,Wuthering Heights
768,Wuthering Heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great,Wuthering Heights
768,thaw or a season of steady rain. And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was,Wuthering Heights
768,"thinking as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all;",Wuthering Heights
768,"but she had the vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed",Wuthering Heights
768,no recognition of material things either by ear or eye.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There’s a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,” I said, gently inserting it in",Wuthering Heights
768,"one hand that rested on her knee. “You must read it immediately,",Wuthering Heights
768,"because it wants an answer. Shall I break the seal?” “Yes,” she",Wuthering Heights
768,"answered, without altering the direction of her eyes. I opened it—it",Wuthering Heights
768,"was very short. “Now,” I continued, “read it.” She drew away her hand,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and let it fall. I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it",Wuthering Heights
768,should please her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed,Wuthering Heights
768,"that at last I resumed—“Must I read it, ma’am? It is from Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle",Wuthering Heights
768,"to arrange her ideas. She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it;",Wuthering Heights
768,and when she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she,Wuthering Heights
768,"had not gathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply,",Wuthering Heights
768,"she merely pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and",Wuthering Heights
768,questioning eagerness.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, he wishes to see you,” said I, guessing her need of an",Wuthering Heights
768,"interpreter. “He’s in the garden by this time, and impatient to know",Wuthering Heights
768,what answer I shall bring.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"As I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath",Wuthering Heights
768,"raise its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back,",Wuthering Heights
768,"announce, by a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did",Wuthering Heights
768,"not consider a stranger. Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened",Wuthering Heights
768,breathlessly. The minute after a step traversed the hall; the open,Wuthering Heights
768,house was too tempting for Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely,Wuthering Heights
768,"he supposed that I was inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to",Wuthering Heights
768,trust to his own audacity. With straining eagerness Catherine gazed,Wuthering Heights
768,towards the entrance of her chamber. He did not hit the right room,Wuthering Heights
768,"directly: she motioned me to admit him, but he found it out ere I could",Wuthering Heights
768,"reach the door, and in a stride or two was at her side, and had her",Wuthering Heights
768,grasped in his arms.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during",Wuthering Heights
768,which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life,Wuthering Heights
768,"before, I daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"plainly saw that he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look",Wuthering Heights
768,"into her face! The same conviction had stricken him as me, from the",Wuthering Heights
768,"instant he beheld her, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery",Wuthering Heights
768,"there—she was fated, sure to die.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, Cathy! Oh, my life! how can I bear it?” was the first sentence he",Wuthering Heights
768,"uttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair. And now",Wuthering Heights
768,he stared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his,Wuthering Heights
768,gaze would bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish:,Wuthering Heights
768,they did not melt.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What now?” said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a",Wuthering Heights
768,suddenly clouded brow: her humour was a mere vane for constantly,Wuthering Heights
768,"varying caprices. “You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff! And",Wuthering Heights
768,"you both come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be",Wuthering Heights
768,"pitied! I shall not pity you, not I. You have killed me—and thriven on",Wuthering Heights
768,"it, I think. How strong you are! How many years do you mean to live",Wuthering Heights
768,after I am gone?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted to rise,",Wuthering Heights
768,"but she seized his hair, and kept him down.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I wish I could hold you,” she continued, bitterly, “till we were both",Wuthering Heights
768,dead! I shouldn’t care what you suffered. I care nothing for your,Wuthering Heights
768,sufferings. Why shouldn’t you suffer? I do! Will you forget me? Will,Wuthering Heights
768,"you be happy when I am in the earth? Will you say twenty years hence,",Wuthering Heights
768,"‘That’s the grave of Catherine Earnshaw? I loved her long ago, and was",Wuthering Heights
768,wretched to lose her; but it is past. I’ve loved many others since: my,Wuthering Heights
768,"children are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not",Wuthering Heights
768,rejoice that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave,Wuthering Heights
768,"them!’ Will you say so, Heathcliff?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Don’t torture me till I’m as mad as yourself,” cried he, wrenching his",Wuthering Heights
768,"head free, and grinding his teeth.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture. Well",Wuthering Heights
768,"might Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her,",Wuthering Heights
768,unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also. Her,Wuthering Heights
768,"present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a",Wuthering Heights
768,bloodless lip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed,Wuthering Heights
768,fingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping. As to her,Wuthering Heights
768,"companion, while raising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm",Wuthering Heights
768,with the other; and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the,Wuthering Heights
768,"requirements of her condition, that on his letting go I saw four",Wuthering Heights
768,distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Are you possessed with a devil,” he pursued, savagely, “to talk in",Wuthering Heights
768,that manner to me when you are dying? Do you reflect that all those,Wuthering Heights
768,"words will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after",Wuthering Heights
768,"you have left me? You know you lie to say I have killed you: and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine, you know that I could as soon forget you as my existence! Is",Wuthering Heights
768,"it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at",Wuthering Heights
768,peace I shall writhe in the torments of hell?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I shall not be at peace,” moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of",Wuthering Heights
768,"physical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which",Wuthering Heights
768,beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation. She said,Wuthering Heights
768,"nothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more",Wuthering Heights
768,kindly—,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff. I only",Wuthering Heights
768,wish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you,Wuthering Heights
768,"hereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own",Wuthering Heights
768,"sake, forgive me! Come here and kneel down again! You never harmed me",Wuthering Heights
768,"in your life. Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember",Wuthering Heights
768,than my harsh words! Won’t you come here again? Do!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so",Wuthering Heights
768,"far as to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion. She bent",Wuthering Heights
768,"round to look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he",Wuthering Heights
768,"walked to the fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards",Wuthering Heights
768,us. Mrs. Linton’s glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke,Wuthering Heights
768,"a new sentiment in her. After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she",Wuthering Heights
768,resumed; addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:—,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"grave. _That_ is how I’m loved! Well, never mind. That is not _my_",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff. I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he’s in my,Wuthering Heights
768,"soul. And,” added she musingly, “the thing that irks me most is this",Wuthering Heights
768,"shattered prison, after all. I’m tired of being enclosed here. I’m",Wuthering Heights
768,"wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there:",Wuthering Heights
768,"not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the",Wuthering Heights
768,"walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it. Nelly, you",Wuthering Heights
768,think you are better and more fortunate than I; in full health and,Wuthering Heights
768,strength: you are sorry for me—very soon that will be altered. I shall,Wuthering Heights
768,be sorry for _you_. I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all. I,Wuthering Heights
768,_wonder_ he won’t be near me!” She went on to herself. “I thought he,Wuthering Heights
768,"wished it. Heathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen now. Do come to",Wuthering Heights
768,"me, Heathcliff.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"chair. At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely",Wuthering Heights
768,"desperate. His eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his",Wuthering Heights
768,"breast heaved convulsively. An instant they held asunder, and then how",Wuthering Heights
768,"they met I hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her,",Wuthering Heights
768,and they were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress,Wuthering Heights
768,"would never be released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly",Wuthering Heights
768,"insensible. He flung himself into the nearest seat, and on my",Wuthering Heights
768,"approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he gnashed at",Wuthering Heights
768,"me, and foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him with greedy",Wuthering Heights
768,jealousy. I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of,Wuthering Heights
768,"my own species: it appeared that he would not understand, though I",Wuthering Heights
768,"spoke to him; so I stood off, and held my tongue, in great perplexity.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,A movement of Catherine’s relieved me a little presently: she put up,Wuthering Heights
768,"her hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her;",Wuthering Heights
768,"while he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“You teach me now how cruel you’ve been—cruel and false. _Why_ did you,Wuthering Heights
768,"despise me? _Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one",Wuthering Heights
768,"word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you",Wuthering Heights
768,"may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they’ll blight",Wuthering Heights
768,you—they’ll damn you. You loved me—then what _right_ had you to leave,Wuthering Heights
768,me? What right—answer me—for the poor fancy you felt for Linton?,Wuthering Heights
768,"Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or",Wuthering Heights
768,"Satan could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did",Wuthering Heights
768,it. I have not broken your heart—_you_ have broken it; and in breaking,Wuthering Heights
768,"it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do",Wuthering Heights
768,"I want to live? What kind of living will it be when you—oh, God! would",Wuthering Heights
768,_you_ like to live with your soul in the grave?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Let me alone. Let me alone,” sobbed Catherine. “If I’ve done wrong,",Wuthering Heights
768,I’m dying for it. It is enough! You left me too: but I won’t upbraid,Wuthering Heights
768,you! I forgive you. Forgive me!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those",Wuthering Heights
768,"wasted hands,” he answered. “Kiss me again; and don’t let me see your",Wuthering Heights
768,eyes! I forgive what you have done to me. I love _my_ murderer—but,Wuthering Heights
768,_yours_! How can I?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"They were silent—their faces hid against each other, and washed by each",Wuthering Heights
768,"other’s tears. At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it",Wuthering Heights
768,seemed Heathcliff _could_ weep on a great occasion like this.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away,",Wuthering Heights
768,"the man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could",Wuthering Heights
768,"distinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse",Wuthering Heights
768,thickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Service is over,” I announced. “My master will be here in half an",Wuthering Heights
768,hour.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she never",Wuthering Heights
768,moved.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road,Wuthering Heights
768,towards the kitchen wing. Mr. Linton was not far behind; he opened the,Wuthering Heights
768,"gate himself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely",Wuthering Heights
768,afternoon that breathed as soft as summer.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Now he is here,” I exclaimed. “For heaven’s sake, hurry down! You’ll",Wuthering Heights
768,not meet any one on the front stairs. Do be quick; and stay among the,Wuthering Heights
768,trees till he is fairly in.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I must go, Cathy,” said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from",Wuthering Heights
768,"his companion’s arms. “But if I live, I’ll see you again before you are",Wuthering Heights
768,asleep. I won’t stray five yards from your window.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You must not go!” she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength",Wuthering Heights
768,"allowed. “You _shall_ not, I tell you.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“For one hour,” he pleaded earnestly.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Not for one minute,” she replied.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I _must_—Linton will be up immediately,” persisted the alarmed",Wuthering Heights
768,intruder.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act—she clung fast,",Wuthering Heights
768,gasping: there was mad resolution in her face.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No!” she shrieked. “Oh, don’t, don’t go. It is the last time! Edgar",Wuthering Heights
768,"will not hurt us. Heathcliff, I shall die! I shall die!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Damn the fool! There he is,” cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his",Wuthering Heights
768,"seat. “Hush, my darling! Hush, hush, Catherine! I’ll stay. If he shot",Wuthering Heights
768,"me so, I’d expire with a blessing on my lips.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,And there they were fast again. I heard my master mounting the,Wuthering Heights
768,stairs—the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Are you going to listen to her ravings?” I said, passionately. “She",Wuthering Heights
768,"does not know what she says. Will you ruin her, because she has not wit",Wuthering Heights
768,to help herself? Get up! You could be free instantly. That is the most,Wuthering Heights
768,"diabolical deed that ever you did. We are all done for—master,",Wuthering Heights
768,"mistress, and servant.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at",Wuthering Heights
768,"the noise. In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to",Wuthering Heights
768,"observe that Catherine’s arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung",Wuthering Heights
768,down.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She’s fainted, or dead,” I thought: “so much the better. Far better",Wuthering Heights
768,"that she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to",Wuthering Heights
768,all about her.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Edgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and",Wuthering Heights
768,"rage. What he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the other stopped all",Wuthering Heights
768,"demonstrations, at once, by placing the lifeless-looking form in his",Wuthering Heights
768,arms.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Look there!” he said. “Unless you be a fiend, help her first—then you",Wuthering Heights
768,shall speak to me!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He walked into the parlour, and sat down. Mr. Linton summoned me, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"with great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to",Wuthering Heights
768,"restore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"moaned, and knew nobody. Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her",Wuthering Heights
768,"hated friend. I did not. I went, at the earliest opportunity, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"besought him to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he",Wuthering Heights
768,should hear from me in the morning how she passed the night.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XVI,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,About twelve o’clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at,Wuthering Heights
768,"Wuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months’ child; and two hours after the",Wuthering Heights
768,"mother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, or know Edgar. The latter’s distraction at his bereavement",Wuthering Heights
768,is a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how,Wuthering Heights
768,"deep the sorrow sunk. A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left",Wuthering Heights
768,"without an heir. I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and",Wuthering Heights
768,I mentally abused old Linton for (what was only natural partiality) the,Wuthering Heights
768,"securing his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son’s. An",Wuthering Heights
768,"unwelcomed infant it was, poor thing! It might have wailed out of life,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence. We",Wuthering Heights
768,redeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as,Wuthering Heights
768,its end is likely to be.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Next morning—bright and cheerful out of doors—stole softened in through,Wuthering Heights
768,"the blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant",Wuthering Heights
768,"with a mellow, tender glow. Edgar Linton had his head laid on the",Wuthering Heights
768,"pillow, and his eyes shut. His young and fair features were almost as",Wuthering Heights
768,"deathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but",Wuthering Heights
768,"_his_ was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Her brow smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a",Wuthering Heights
768,smile; no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.,Wuthering Heights
768,And I partook of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never,Wuthering Heights
768,in a holier frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine,Wuthering Heights
768,rest. I instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours,Wuthering Heights
768,before: “Incomparably beyond and above us all! Whether still on earth,Wuthering Heights
768,"or now in heaven, her spirit is at home with God!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I don’t know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise",Wuthering Heights
768,"than happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied",Wuthering Heights
768,or despairing mourner share the duty with me. I see a repose that,Wuthering Heights
768,"neither earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the",Wuthering Heights
768,endless and shadowless hereafter—the Eternity they have entered—where,Wuthering Heights
768,"life is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in",Wuthering Heights
768,its fulness. I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is,Wuthering Heights
768,"even in a love like Mr. Linton’s, when he so regretted Catherine’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"blessed release! To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward",Wuthering Heights
768,"and impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of",Wuthering Heights
768,peace at last. One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not,Wuthering Heights
768,"then, in the presence of her corpse. It asserted its own tranquillity,",Wuthering Heights
768,which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Do you believe such people _are_ happy in the other world, sir? I’d",Wuthering Heights
768,give a great deal to know.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I declined answering Mrs. Dean’s question, which struck me as something",Wuthering Heights
768,heterodox. She proceeded:,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Retracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to",Wuthering Heights
768,think she is; but we’ll leave her with her Maker.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the",Wuthering Heights
768,room and steal out to the pure refreshing air. The servants thought me,Wuthering Heights
768,"gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my",Wuthering Heights
768,chief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff. If he had remained among the,Wuthering Heights
768,"larches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the",Wuthering Heights
768,"Grange; unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger",Wuthering Heights
768,"going to Gimmerton. If he had come nearer, he would probably be aware,",Wuthering Heights
768,"from the lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of",Wuthering Heights
768,"the outer doors, that all was not right within. I wished, yet feared,",Wuthering Heights
768,"to find him. I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get",Wuthering Heights
768,"it over; but _how_ to do it I did not know. He was there—at least, a",Wuthering Heights
768,"few yards further in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat",Wuthering Heights
768,"off, and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded",Wuthering Heights
768,"branches, and fell pattering round him. He had been standing a long",Wuthering Heights
768,"time in that position, for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing",Wuthering Heights
768,"scarcely three feet from him, busy in building their nest, and",Wuthering Heights
768,regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber. They,Wuthering Heights
768,"flew off at my approach, and he raised his eyes and spoke:—“She’s",Wuthering Heights
768,dead!” he said; “I’ve not waited for you to learn that. Put your,Wuthering Heights
768,handkerchief away—don’t snivel before me. Damn you all! she wants none,Wuthering Heights
768,of _your_ tears!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity creatures,Wuthering Heights
768,that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others. When I,Wuthering Heights
768,"first looked into his face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of",Wuthering Heights
768,the catastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was,Wuthering Heights
768,"quelled and he prayed, because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on",Wuthering Heights
768,the ground.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, she’s dead!” I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take",Wuthering Heights
768,due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Did _she_ take due warning, then?” asked Heathcliff, attempting a",Wuthering Heights
768,"sneer. “Did she die like a saint? Come, give me a true history of the",Wuthering Heights
768,event. How did—?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony,",Wuthering Heights
768,"defying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“How did she die?” he resumed, at last—fain, notwithstanding his",Wuthering Heights
768,"hardihood, to have a support behind him; for, after the struggle, he",Wuthering Heights
768,"trembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Poor wretch!” I thought; “you have a heart and nerves the same as your,Wuthering Heights
768,brother men! Why should you be anxious to conceal them? Your pride,Wuthering Heights
768,"cannot blind God! You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of",Wuthering Heights
768,humiliation.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Quietly as a lamb!” I answered, aloud. “She drew a sigh, and stretched",Wuthering Heights
768,"herself, like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five",Wuthering Heights
768,"minutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And—did she ever mention me?” he asked, hesitating, as if he dreaded",Wuthering Heights
768,the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not,Wuthering Heights
768,bear to hear.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from the time you,Wuthering Heights
768,"left her,” I said. “She lies with a sweet smile on her face; and her",Wuthering Heights
768,latest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days. Her life closed in a,Wuthering Heights
768,gentle dream—may she wake as kindly in the other world!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“May she wake in torment!” he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping",Wuthering Heights
768,"his foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why, she’s a liar to the end! Where is she? Not _there_—not in",Wuthering Heights
768,heaven—not perished—where? Oh! you said you cared nothing for my,Wuthering Heights
768,sufferings! And I pray one prayer—I repeat it till my tongue,Wuthering Heights
768,"stiffens—Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living;",Wuthering Heights
768,"you said I killed you—haunt me, then! The murdered _do_ haunt their",Wuthering Heights
768,"murderers, I believe. I know that ghosts _have_ wandered on earth. Be",Wuthering Heights
768,with me always—take any form—drive me mad! only _do_ not leave me in,Wuthering Heights
768,"this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes,",Wuthering Heights
768,"howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death",Wuthering Heights
768,with knives and spears. I observed several splashes of blood about the,Wuthering Heights
768,"bark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably",Wuthering Heights
768,the scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the,Wuthering Heights
768,"night. It hardly moved my compassion—it appalled me: still, I felt",Wuthering Heights
768,reluctant to quit him so. But the moment he recollected himself enough,Wuthering Heights
768,"to notice me watching, he thundered a command for me to go, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,obeyed. He was beyond my skill to quiet or console!,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Mrs. Linton’s funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday,Wuthering Heights
768,"following her decease; and till then her coffin remained uncovered, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"strewn with flowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing-room.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton spent his days and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and—a",Wuthering Heights
768,"circumstance concealed from all but me—Heathcliff spent his nights, at",Wuthering Heights
768,"least, outside, equally a stranger to repose. I held no communication",Wuthering Heights
768,"with him; still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and on the Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer",Wuthering Heights
768,"fatigue, had been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and",Wuthering Heights
768,opened one of the windows; moved by his perseverance to give him a,Wuthering Heights
768,chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu. He,Wuthering Heights
768,"did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity, cautiously and",Wuthering Heights
768,briefly; too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Indeed, I shouldn’t have discovered that he had been there, except for",Wuthering Heights
768,"the disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse’s face, and for",Wuthering Heights
768,"observing on the floor a curl of light hair, fastened with a silver",Wuthering Heights
768,"thread; which, on examination, I ascertained to have been taken from a",Wuthering Heights
768,locket hung round Catherine’s neck. Heathcliff had opened the trinket,Wuthering Heights
768,"and cast out its contents, replacing them by a black lock of his own. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"twisted the two, and enclosed them together.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his",Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XVII,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,That Friday made the last of our fine days for a month. In the evening,Wuthering Heights
768,"the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"brought rain first, and then sleet and snow. On the morrow one could",Wuthering Heights
768,hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses,Wuthering Heights
768,"and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent,",Wuthering Heights
768,"the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened. And dreary,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over! My master kept his",Wuthering Heights
768,"room; I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a",Wuthering Heights
768,"nursery: and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid",Wuthering Heights
768,"on my knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still",Wuthering Heights
768,"driving flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and some person entered, out of breath and laughing! My anger was",Wuthering Heights
768,greater than my astonishment for a minute. I supposed it one of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"maids, and I cried—“Have done! How dare you show your giddiness here?",Wuthering Heights
768,What would Mr. Linton say if he heard you?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Excuse me!” answered a familiar voice; “but I know Edgar is in bed,",Wuthering Heights
768,and I cannot stop myself.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"With that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her",Wuthering Heights
768,hand to her side.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!” she continued, after",Wuthering Heights
768,a pause; “except where I’ve flown. I couldn’t count the number of falls,Wuthering Heights
768,"I’ve had. Oh, I’m aching all over! Don’t be alarmed! There shall be an",Wuthering Heights
768,explanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to,Wuthering Heights
768,"step out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a",Wuthering Heights
768,servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff. She certainly seemed in no laughing,Wuthering Heights
768,"predicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and",Wuthering Heights
768,"water; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore,",Wuthering Heights
768,befitting her age more than her position: a low frock with short,Wuthering Heights
768,"sleeves, and nothing on either head or neck. The frock was of light",Wuthering Heights
768,"silk, and clung to her with wet, and her feet were protected merely by",Wuthering Heights
768,"thin slippers; add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the",Wuthering Heights
768,"cold prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and",Wuthering Heights
768,"bruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue; and",Wuthering Heights
768,you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when I had had,Wuthering Heights
768,leisure to examine her.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“My dear young lady,” I exclaimed, “I’ll stir nowhere, and hear",Wuthering Heights
768,"nothing, till you have removed every article of your clothes, and put",Wuthering Heights
768,"on dry things; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so",Wuthering Heights
768,it is needless to order the carriage.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Certainly I shall,” she said; “walking or riding: yet I’ve no",Wuthering Heights
768,"objection to dress myself decently. And—ah, see how it flows down my",Wuthering Heights
768,neck now! The fire does make it smart.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would let me",Wuthering Heights
768,touch her; and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get,Wuthering Heights
768,"ready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain",Wuthering Heights
768,her consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Now, Ellen,” she said, when my task was finished and she was seated in",Wuthering Heights
768,"an easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her, “you sit",Wuthering Heights
768,"down opposite me, and put poor Catherine’s baby away: I don’t like to",Wuthering Heights
768,"see it! You mustn’t think I care little for Catherine, because I",Wuthering Heights
768,"behaved so foolishly on entering: I’ve cried, too, bitterly—yes, more",Wuthering Heights
768,"than any one else has reason to cry. We parted unreconciled, you",Wuthering Heights
768,"remember, and I sha’n’t forgive myself. But, for all that, I was not",Wuthering Heights
768,"going to sympathise with him—the brute beast! Oh, give me the poker!",Wuthering Heights
768,This is the last thing of his I have about me:” she slipped the gold,Wuthering Heights
768,"ring from her third finger, and threw it on the floor. “I’ll smash it!”",Wuthering Heights
768,"she continued, striking it with childish spite, “and then I’ll burn",Wuthering Heights
768,it!” and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals.,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There! he shall buy another, if he gets me back again. He’d be capable",Wuthering Heights
768,"of coming to seek me, to tease Edgar. I dare not stay, lest that notion",Wuthering Heights
768,"should possess his wicked head! And besides, Edgar has not been kind,",Wuthering Heights
768,has he? And I won’t come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him,Wuthering Heights
768,"into more trouble. Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though,",Wuthering Heights
768,"if I had not learned he was out of the way, I’d have halted at the",Wuthering Heights
768,"kitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted,",Wuthering Heights
768,and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed—of that,Wuthering Heights
768,"incarnate goblin! Ah, he was in such a fury! If he had caught me! It’s",Wuthering Heights
768,a pity Earnshaw is not his match in strength: I wouldn’t have run till,Wuthering Heights
768,"I’d seen him all but demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, don’t talk so fast, Miss!” I interrupted; “you’ll disorder the",Wuthering Heights
768,"handkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Drink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is",Wuthering Heights
768,"sadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“An undeniable truth,” she replied. “Listen to that child! It maintains",Wuthering Heights
768,a constant wail—send it out of my hearing for an hour; I sha’n’t stay,Wuthering Heights
768,any longer.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I rang the bell, and committed it to a servant’s care; and then I",Wuthering Heights
768,inquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an,Wuthering Heights
768,"unlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as she refused remaining",Wuthering Heights
768,with us.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I ought, and I wished to remain,” answered she, “to cheer Edgar and",Wuthering Heights
768,"take care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my",Wuthering Heights
768,right home. But I tell you he wouldn’t let me! Do you think he could,Wuthering Heights
768,bear to see me grow fat and merry—could bear to think that we were,Wuthering Heights
768,"tranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort? Now, I have the",Wuthering Heights
768,"satisfaction of being sure that he detests me, to the point of its",Wuthering Heights
768,annoying him seriously to have me within ear-shot or eyesight: I,Wuthering Heights
768,"notice, when I enter his presence, the muscles of his countenance are",Wuthering Heights
768,involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred; partly arising,Wuthering Heights
768,from his knowledge of the good causes I have to feel that sentiment for,Wuthering Heights
768,"him, and partly from original aversion. It is strong enough to make me",Wuthering Heights
768,"feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over England, supposing",Wuthering Heights
768,I contrived a clear escape; and therefore I must get quite away. I’ve,Wuthering Heights
768,recovered from my first desire to be killed by him: I’d rather he’d,Wuthering Heights
768,"kill himself! He has extinguished my love effectually, and so I’m at my",Wuthering Heights
768,ease. I can recollect yet how I loved him; and can dimly imagine that I,Wuthering Heights
768,"could still be loving him, if—no, no! Even if he had doted on me, the",Wuthering Heights
768,devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow. Catherine,Wuthering Heights
768,"had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him so",Wuthering Heights
768,"well. Monster! would that he could be blotted out of creation, and out",Wuthering Heights
768,of my memory!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hush, hush! He’s a human being,” I said. “Be more charitable: there",Wuthering Heights
768,are worse men than he is yet!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He’s not a human being,” she retorted; “and he has no claim on my",Wuthering Heights
768,"charity. I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"flung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he",Wuthering Heights
768,"has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would not,",Wuthering Heights
768,"though he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood",Wuthering Heights
768,"for Catherine! No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn’t!” And here Isabella began",Wuthering Heights
768,"to cry; but, immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she",Wuthering Heights
768,"recommenced. “You asked, what has driven me to flight at last? I was",Wuthering Heights
768,"compelled to attempt it, because I had succeeded in rousing his rage a",Wuthering Heights
768,pitch above his malignity. Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers,Wuthering Heights
768,requires more coolness than knocking on the head. He was worked up to,Wuthering Heights
768,"forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to murderous",Wuthering Heights
768,violence. I experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him: the,Wuthering Heights
768,"sense of pleasure woke my instinct of self-preservation, so I fairly",Wuthering Heights
768,broke free; and if ever I come into his hands again he is welcome to a,Wuthering Heights
768,signal revenge.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral. He",Wuthering Heights
768,kept himself sober for the purpose—tolerably sober: not going to bed,Wuthering Heights
768,"mad at six o’clock and getting up drunk at twelve. Consequently, he",Wuthering Heights
768,"rose, in suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and instead, he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by",Wuthering Heights
768,tumblerfuls.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Heathcliff—I shudder to name him! has been a stranger in the house,Wuthering Heights
768,"from last Sunday till to-day. Whether the angels have fed him, or his",Wuthering Heights
768,"kin beneath, I cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with us for",Wuthering Heights
768,"nearly a week. He has just come home at dawn, and gone upstairs to his",Wuthering Heights
768,chamber; locking himself in—as if anybody dreamt of coveting his,Wuthering Heights
768,"company! There he has continued, praying like a Methodist: only the",Wuthering Heights
768,"deity he implored is senseless dust and ashes; and God, when addressed,",Wuthering Heights
768,was curiously confounded with his own black father! After concluding,Wuthering Heights
768,these precious orisons—and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse,Wuthering Heights
768,and his voice was strangled in his throat—he would be off again; always,Wuthering Heights
768,straight down to the Grange! I wonder Edgar did not send for a,Wuthering Heights
768,"constable, and give him into custody! For me, grieved as I was about",Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of",Wuthering Heights
768,deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“I recovered spirits sufficient to hear Joseph’s eternal lectures,Wuthering Heights
768,"without weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot",Wuthering Heights
768,of a frightened thief than formerly. You wouldn’t think that I should,Wuthering Heights
768,cry at anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable,Wuthering Heights
768,"companions. I’d rather sit with Hindley, and hear his awful talk, than",Wuthering Heights
768,"with ‘t’ little maister’ and his staunch supporter, that odious old",Wuthering Heights
768,"man! When Heathcliff is in, I’m often obliged to seek the kitchen and",Wuthering Heights
768,"their society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he",Wuthering Heights
768,"is not, as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one",Wuthering Heights
768,"corner of the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw may occupy",Wuthering Heights
768,himself; and he does not interfere with my arrangements. He is quieter,Wuthering Heights
768,"now than he used to be, if no one provokes him: more sullen and",Wuthering Heights
768,"depressed, and less furious. Joseph affirms he’s sure he’s an altered",Wuthering Heights
768,"man: that the Lord has touched his heart, and he is saved ‘so as by",Wuthering Heights
768,fire.’ I’m puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change: but it is,Wuthering Heights

768,“Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on,Wuthering Heights
768,"towards twelve. It seemed so dismal to go upstairs, with the wild snow",Wuthering Heights
768,"blowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard",Wuthering Heights
768,and the new-made grave! I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page,Wuthering Heights
768,"before me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps meditating on",Wuthering Heights

768,"had vanished from the world, never to be restored.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen,Wuthering Heights
768,latch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual;,Wuthering Heights
768,"owing, I suppose, to the sudden storm. That entrance was fastened, and",Wuthering Heights
768,we heard him coming round to get in by the other. I rose with an,Wuthering Heights
768,"irrepressible expression of what I felt on my lips, which induced my",Wuthering Heights
768,"companion, who had been staring towards the door, to turn and look at",Wuthering Heights
768,me.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘I’ll keep him out five minutes,’ he exclaimed. ‘You won’t object?’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘No, you may keep him out the whole night for me,’ I answered. ‘Do!",Wuthering Heights
768,"put the key in the lock, and draw the bolts.’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front; he then,Wuthering Heights
768,"came and brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over",Wuthering Heights
768,"it, and searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that",Wuthering Heights
768,"gleamed from his: as he both looked and felt like an assassin, he",Wuthering Heights
768,couldn’t exactly find that; but he discovered enough to encourage him,Wuthering Heights
768,to speak.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘You, and I,’ he said, ‘have each a great debt to settle with the man",Wuthering Heights
768,"out yonder! If we were neither of us cowards, we might combine to",Wuthering Heights
768,discharge it. Are you as soft as your brother? Are you willing to,Wuthering Heights
768,"endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘I’m weary of enduring now,’ I replied; ‘and I’d be glad of a",Wuthering Heights
768,retaliation that wouldn’t recoil on myself; but treachery and violence,Wuthering Heights
768,are spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them,Wuthering Heights
768,worse than their enemies.’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“‘Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!’,Wuthering Heights
768,"cried Hindley. ‘Mrs. Heathcliff, I’ll ask you to do nothing; but sit",Wuthering Heights
768,"still and be dumb. Tell me now, can you? I’m sure you would have as",Wuthering Heights
768,much pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend’s,Wuthering Heights
768,existence; he’ll be _your_ death unless you overreach him; and he’ll be,Wuthering Heights
768,_my_ ruin. Damn the hellish villain! He knocks at the door as if he,Wuthering Heights
768,"were master here already! Promise to hold your tongue, and before that",Wuthering Heights
768,clock strikes—it wants three minutes of one—you’re a free woman!’,Wuthering Heights

768,“He took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his,Wuthering Heights
768,"breast, and would have turned down the candle. I snatched it away,",Wuthering Heights
768,"however, and seized his arm.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“‘I’ll not hold my tongue!’ I said; ‘you mustn’t touch him. Let the,Wuthering Heights

768,"“‘No! I’ve formed my resolution, and by God I’ll execute it!’ cried the",Wuthering Heights
768,"desperate being. ‘I’ll do you a kindness in spite of yourself, and",Wuthering Heights
768,Hareton justice! And you needn’t trouble your head to screen me;,Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a",Wuthering Heights

768,intended victim of the fate which awaited him.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘You’d better seek shelter somewhere else to-night!’ I exclaimed, in",Wuthering Heights

768,persist in endeavouring to enter.’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘You’d better open the door, you—’ he answered, addressing me by some",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“With that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire;,Wuthering Heights
768,having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any,Wuthering Heights
768,anxiety for the danger that menaced him. Earnshaw swore passionately at,Wuthering Heights
768,me: affirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all sorts of,Wuthering Heights
768,"names for the base spirit I evinced. And I, in my secret heart (and",Wuthering Heights
768,"conscience never reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be",Wuthering Heights
768,for _him_ should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a blessing,Wuthering Heights
768,for _me_ should he send Heathcliff to his right abode! As I sat nursing,Wuthering Heights
768,"these reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by",Wuthering Heights
768,"a blow from the latter individual, and his black countenance looked",Wuthering Heights
768,blightingly through. The stanchions stood too close to suffer his,Wuthering Heights
768,"shoulders to follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied security. His",Wuthering Heights
768,"hair and clothes were whitened with snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth,",Wuthering Heights
768,"revealed by cold and wrath, gleamed through the dark.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Isabella, let me in, or I’ll make you repent!’ he ‘girned,’ as Joseph",Wuthering Heights
768,calls it.,Wuthering Heights

768,"winter returns, you must run for shelter! Heathcliff, if I were you,",Wuthering Heights
768,I’d go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog. The,Wuthering Heights
768,"world is surely not worth living in now, is it? You had distinctly",Wuthering Heights
768,impressed on me the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life:,Wuthering Heights
768,I can’t imagine how you think of surviving her loss.’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m afraid, Ellen, you’ll set me down as really wicked; but you don’t",Wuthering Heights
768,"know all, so don’t judge. I wouldn’t have aided or abetted an attempt",Wuthering Heights
768,"on even _his_ life for anything. Wish that he were dead, I must; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"therefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the",Wuthering Heights
768,"consequences of my taunting speech, when he flung himself on Earnshaw’s",Wuthering Heights
768,weapon and wrenched it from his grasp.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its",Wuthering Heights
768,"owner’s wrist. Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the",Wuthering Heights
768,"flesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into his pocket. He then",Wuthering Heights
768,"took a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang",Wuthering Heights
768,in. His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow,Wuthering Heights
768,"of blood, that gushed from an artery or a large vein. The ruffian",Wuthering Heights
768,"kicked and trampled on him, and dashed his head repeatedly against the",Wuthering Heights
768,"flags, holding me with one hand, meantime, to prevent me summoning",Wuthering Heights
768,Joseph. He exerted preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing,Wuthering Heights
768,"him completely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and",Wuthering Heights
768,dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle. There he tore,Wuthering Heights
768,"off the sleeve of Earnshaw’s coat, and bound up the wound with brutal",Wuthering Heights
768,roughness; spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically,Wuthering Heights
768,"as he had kicked before. Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking",Wuthering Heights
768,"the old servant; who, having gathered by degrees the purport of my",Wuthering Heights
768,"hasty tale, hurried below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at",Wuthering Heights
768,once.,Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights

768,"and should he last another month, I’ll have him to an asylum. And how",Wuthering Heights
768,"the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound? Don’t",Wuthering Heights
768,"stand muttering and mumbling there. Come, I’m not going to nurse him.",Wuthering Heights

768,Lord—’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and flung a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he",Wuthering Heights
768,"joined his hands and began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its",Wuthering Heights
768,odd phraseology. I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at,Wuthering Heights
768,"nothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves",Wuthering Heights
768,at the foot of the gallows.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Oh, I forgot you,’ said the tyrant. ‘You shall do that. Down with",Wuthering Heights

768,is work fit for you!’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, who",Wuthering Heights
768,"steadily concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would",Wuthering Heights
768,"set off for the Grange directly. Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"though he had fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this. He was so",Wuthering Heights
768,"obstinate in his resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to",Wuthering Heights
768,compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing,Wuthering Heights
768,"over me, heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the",Wuthering Heights
768,account in answer to his questions. It required a great deal of labour,Wuthering Heights
768,to satisfy the old man that Heathcliff was not the aggressor;,Wuthering Heights
768,"especially with my hardly-wrung replies. However, Mr. Earnshaw soon",Wuthering Heights
768,convinced him that he was alive still; Joseph hastened to administer a,Wuthering Heights
768,"dose of spirits, and by their succour his master presently regained",Wuthering Heights
768,"motion and consciousness. Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was",Wuthering Heights
768,"ignorant of the treatment received while insensible, called him",Wuthering Heights
768,deliriously intoxicated; and said he should not notice his atrocious,Wuthering Heights
768,"conduct further, but advised him to get to bed. To my joy, he left us,",Wuthering Heights
768,"after giving this judicious counsel, and Hindley stretched himself on",Wuthering Heights
768,"the hearthstone. I departed to my own room, marvelling that I had",Wuthering Heights
768,escaped so easily.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost",Wuthering Heights
768,"as gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney. Neither appeared",Wuthering Heights
768,"inclined to dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"commenced alone. Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at",Wuthering Heights
768,"intervals, I cast a look towards my silent companions, and felt the",Wuthering Heights
768,"comfort of a quiet conscience within me. After I had done, I ventured",Wuthering Heights
768,"on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"seat, and kneeling in the corner beside him.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his",Wuthering Heights
768,features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone. His,Wuthering Heights
768,"forehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so",Wuthering Heights
768,"diabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were",Wuthering Heights
768,"nearly quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes",Wuthering Heights
768,"were wet then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in",Wuthering Heights
768,"an expression of unspeakable sadness. Had it been another, I would have",Wuthering Heights
768,"covered my face in the presence of such grief. In _his_ case, I was",Wuthering Heights
768,"gratified; and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I",Wuthering Heights
768,couldn’t miss this chance of sticking in a dart: his weakness was the,Wuthering Heights
768,only time when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Fie, fie, Miss!” I interrupted. “One might suppose you had never",Wuthering Heights
768,"opened a Bible in your life. If God afflict your enemies, surely that",Wuthering Heights
768,ought to suffice you. It is both mean and presumptuous to add your,Wuthering Heights
768,torture to his!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“In general I’ll allow that it would be, Ellen,” she continued; “but",Wuthering Heights
768,"what misery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand",Wuthering Heights
768,"in it? I’d rather he suffered _less_, if I might cause his sufferings",Wuthering Heights
768,"and he might _know_ that I was the cause. Oh, I owe him so much. On",Wuthering Heights
768,"only one condition can I hope to forgive him. It is, if I may take an",Wuthering Heights
768,"eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a",Wuthering Heights
768,"wrench: reduce him to my level. As he was the first to injure, make him",Wuthering Heights
768,"the first to implore pardon; and then—why then, Ellen, I might show you",Wuthering Heights
768,"some generosity. But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and therefore I cannot forgive him. Hindley wanted some water, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"handed him a glass, and asked him how he was.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Not as ill as I wish,’ he replied. ‘But leaving out my arm, every",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Yes, no wonder,’ was my next remark. ‘Catherine used to boast that",Wuthering Heights
768,she stood between you and bodily harm: she meant that certain persons,Wuthering Heights
768,would not hurt you for fear of offending her. It’s well people don’t,Wuthering Heights
768,"_really_ rise from their grave, or, last night, she might have",Wuthering Heights
768,"witnessed a repulsive scene! Are not you bruised, and cut over your",Wuthering Heights
768,chest and shoulders?’,Wuthering Heights

768,"“‘He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground,’ I",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe;",Wuthering Heights
768,"who, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him:",Wuthering Heights

768,struggle.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Nay, it’s enough that he has murdered one of you,’ I observed aloud.",Wuthering Heights
768,"‘At the Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now",Wuthering Heights
768,"had it not been for Mr. Heathcliff. After all, it is preferable to be",Wuthering Heights
768,hated than loved by him. When I recollect how happy we were—how happy,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine was before he came—I’m fit to curse the day.’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than",Wuthering Heights
768,"the spirit of the person who said it. His attention was roused, I saw,",Wuthering Heights
768,"for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath",Wuthering Heights
768,"in suffocating sighs. I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully. The",Wuthering Heights
768,clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which,Wuthering Heights
768,"usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not",Wuthering Heights
768,fear to hazard another sound of derision.,Wuthering Heights

768,"Catherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible,",Wuthering Heights
768,"degrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a",Wuthering Heights
768,similar picture! _She_ wouldn’t have borne your abominable behaviour,Wuthering Heights
768,quietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice.’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“The back of the settle and Earnshaw’s person interposed between me and,Wuthering Heights
768,"him; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife",Wuthering Heights
768,"from the table and flung it at my head. It struck beneath my ear, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"stopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to",Wuthering Heights
768,the door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than,Wuthering Heights
768,his missile. The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his,Wuthering Heights
768,"part, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together",Wuthering Heights
768,on the hearth. In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to,Wuthering Heights
768,"his master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies",Wuthering Heights
768,"from a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from",Wuthering Heights
768,"purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,",Wuthering Heights
768,"quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the",Wuthering Heights
768,beacon-light of the Grange. And far rather would I be condemned to a,Wuthering Heights
768,"perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night,",Wuthering Heights
768,abide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"bidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she",Wuthering Heights
768,"stepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar’s and Catherine’s portraits,",Wuthering Heights
768,"bestowed a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage,",Wuthering Heights
768,"accompanied by Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her",Wuthering Heights
768,"mistress. She was driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but",Wuthering Heights
768,a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when,Wuthering Heights
768,"things were more settled. I believe her new abode was in the south,",Wuthering Heights
768,near London; there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her,Wuthering Heights
768,"escape. He was christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him",Wuthering Heights
768,"to be an ailing, peevish creature.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she",Wuthering Heights
768,"lived. I refused to tell. He remarked that it was not of any moment,",Wuthering Heights
768,only she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with,Wuthering Heights
768,"him, if he had to keep her himself. Though I would give no information,",Wuthering Heights
768,"he discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of",Wuthering Heights
768,"residence and the existence of the child. Still, he didn’t molest her:",Wuthering Heights
768,"for which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose. He often",Wuthering Heights
768,"asked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled",Wuthering Heights
768,"grimly, and observed: “They wish me to hate it too, do they?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I don’t think they wish you to know anything about it,” I answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But I’ll have it,” he said, “when I want it. They may reckon on that!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen,Wuthering Heights
768,"years after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a",Wuthering Heights
768,little more.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,On the day succeeding Isabella’s unexpected visit I had no opportunity,Wuthering Heights
768,"of speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for",Wuthering Heights
768,"discussing nothing. When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased",Wuthering Heights
768,him that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an,Wuthering Heights
768,intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to,Wuthering Heights
768,"allow. So deep and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from",Wuthering Heights
768,"going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up",Wuthering Heights
768,"his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the",Wuthering Heights
768,"village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within",Wuthering Heights
768,the limits of his park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on,Wuthering Heights
768,"the moors, and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or",Wuthering Heights
768,early morning before other wanderers were abroad. But he was too good,Wuthering Heights
768,to be thoroughly unhappy long. _He_ didn’t pray for Catherine’s soul to,Wuthering Heights
768,"haunt him. Time brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than",Wuthering Heights
768,"common joy. He recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and",Wuthering Heights
768,hopeful aspiring to the better world; where he doubted not she was,Wuthering Heights
768,gone.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"And he had earthly consolation and affections also. For a few days, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that",Wuthering Heights
768,"coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could",Wuthering Heights
768,stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot’s sceptre in his,Wuthering Heights
768,"heart. It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full,",Wuthering Heights
768,as he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because,Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff had a habit of doing so. The little one was always Cathy: it,Wuthering Heights
768,"formed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with",Wuthering Heights
768,"her; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than",Wuthering Heights
768,from its being his own.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and",Wuthering Heights
768,perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so,Wuthering Heights
768,"opposite in similar circumstances. They had both been fond husbands,",Wuthering Heights
768,and were both attached to their children; and I could not see how they,Wuthering Heights
768,"shouldn’t both have taken the same road, for good or evil. But, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"thought in my mind, Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has",Wuthering Heights
768,"shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man. When his ship struck,",Wuthering Heights
768,"the captain abandoned his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save",Wuthering Heights
768,"her, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless",Wuthering Heights
768,"vessel. Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal",Wuthering Heights
768,"and faithful soul: he trusted God; and God comforted him. One hoped,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and the other despaired: they chose their own lots, and were",Wuthering Heights
768,righteously doomed to endure them. But you’ll not want to hear my,Wuthering Heights
768,"moralising, Mr. Lockwood; you’ll judge, as well as I can, all these",Wuthering Heights
768,"things: at least, you’ll think you will, and that’s the same. The end",Wuthering Heights
768,of Earnshaw was what might have been expected; it followed fast on his,Wuthering Heights
768,"sister’s: there were scarcely six months between them. We, at the",Wuthering Heights
768,"Grange, never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it;",Wuthering Heights
768,all that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the,Wuthering Heights
768,preparations for the funeral. Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to,Wuthering Heights
768,my master.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, Nelly,” said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not",Wuthering Heights
768,"to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, “it’s yours and",Wuthering Heights
768,"my turn to go into mourning at present. Who’s given us the slip now, do",Wuthering Heights
768,you think?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Who?” I asked in a flurry.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why, guess!” he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a",Wuthering Heights
768,hook by the door. “And nip up the corner of your apron: I’m certain,Wuthering Heights
768,you’ll need it.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?” I exclaimed.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What! would you have tears for him?” said the doctor. “No,",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff’s a tough young fellow: he looks blooming to-day. I’ve just,Wuthering Heights
768,seen him. He’s rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?” I repeated impatiently.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hindley Earnshaw! Your old friend Hindley,” he replied, “and my wicked",Wuthering Heights
768,gossip: though he’s been too wild for me this long while. There! I said,Wuthering Heights
768,we should draw water. But cheer up! He died true to his character:,Wuthering Heights
768,"drunk as a lord. Poor lad! I’m sorry, too. One can’t help missing an",Wuthering Heights
768,old companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man,Wuthering Heights
768,"imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn. He’s barely",Wuthering Heights
768,"twenty-seven, it seems; that’s your own age: who would have thought you",Wuthering Heights
768,were born in one year?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton’s,Wuthering Heights
768,death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the,Wuthering Heights
768,"porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get",Wuthering Heights
768,another servant to introduce him to the master. I could not hinder,Wuthering Heights
768,myself from pondering on the question—“Had he had fair play?” Whatever,Wuthering Heights
768,"I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious",Wuthering Heights
768,"that I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and",Wuthering Heights
768,assist in the last duties to the dead. Mr. Linton was extremely,Wuthering Heights
768,"reluctant to consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless",Wuthering Heights
768,condition in which he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother,Wuthering Heights
768,"had a claim on my services as strong as his own. Besides, I reminded",Wuthering Heights
768,"him that the child Hareton was his wife’s nephew, and, in the absence",Wuthering Heights
768,"of nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and",Wuthering Heights
768,"must inquire how the property was left, and look over the concerns of",Wuthering Heights
768,"his brother-in-law. He was unfit for attending to such matters then,",Wuthering Heights
768,but he bid me speak to his lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.,Wuthering Heights
768,"His lawyer had been Earnshaw’s also: I called at the village, and asked",Wuthering Heights
768,"him to accompany me. He shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff",Wuthering Heights
768,"should be let alone; affirming, if the truth were known, Hareton would",Wuthering Heights
768,be found little else than a beggar.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“His father died in debt,” he said; “the whole property is mortgaged,",Wuthering Heights
768,and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity,Wuthering Heights
768,"of creating some interest in the creditor’s heart, that he may be",Wuthering Heights
768,inclined to deal leniently towards him.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see",Wuthering Heights
768,"everything carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient",Wuthering Heights
768,"distress, expressed satisfaction at my presence. Mr. Heathcliff said he",Wuthering Heights
768,did not perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the,Wuthering Heights
768,"arrangements for the funeral, if I chose.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Correctly,” he remarked, “that fool’s body should be buried at the",Wuthering Heights
768,"cross-roads, without ceremony of any kind. I happened to leave him ten",Wuthering Heights
768,"minutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two",Wuthering Heights
768,"doors of the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking",Wuthering Heights
768,"himself to death deliberately! We broke in this morning, for we heard",Wuthering Heights
768,"him snorting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle:",Wuthering Heights
768,"flaying and scalping would not have wakened him. I sent for Kenneth,",Wuthering Heights
768,and he came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was,Wuthering Heights
768,"both dead and cold, and stark; and so you’ll allow it was useless",Wuthering Heights
768,making more stir about him!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“I’d rayther he’d goan hisseln for t’ doctor! I sud ha’ taen tent o’ t’,Wuthering Heights
768,"maister better nor him—and he warn’t deead when I left, naught o’ t’",Wuthering Heights
768,soart!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I insisted on the funeral being respectable. Mr. Heathcliff said I,Wuthering Heights
768,"might have my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that",Wuthering Heights
768,the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket. He maintained a,Wuthering Heights
768,"hard, careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if",Wuthering Heights
768,"anything, it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult",Wuthering Heights
768,"work successfully executed. I observed once, indeed, something like",Wuthering Heights
768,exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the,Wuthering Heights
768,coffin from the house. He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and,Wuthering Heights
768,"previous to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on",Wuthering Heights
768,"to the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, “Now, my bonny lad, you",Wuthering Heights
768,"are _mine_! And we’ll see if one tree won’t grow as crooked as another,",Wuthering Heights
768,with the same wind to twist it!” The unsuspecting thing was pleased at,Wuthering Heights
768,"this speech: he played with Heathcliff’s whiskers, and stroked his",Wuthering Heights
768,"cheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, “That boy must",Wuthering Heights
768,"go back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir. There is nothing in the",Wuthering Heights
768,world less yours than he is!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Does Linton say so?” he demanded.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Of course—he has ordered me to take him,” I replied.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well,” said the scoundrel, “we’ll not argue the subject now: but I",Wuthering Heights
768,have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your,Wuthering Heights
768,"master that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt",Wuthering Heights
768,to remove it. I don’t engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I’ll be,Wuthering Heights
768,pretty sure to make the other come! Remember to tell him.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,This hint was enough to bind our hands. I repeated its substance on my,Wuthering Heights
768,"return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke",Wuthering Heights
768,no more of interfering. I’m not aware that he could have done it to any,Wuthering Heights
768,"purpose, had he been ever so willing.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm,Wuthering Heights
768,"possession, and proved to the attorney—who, in his turn, proved it to",Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Linton—that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for,Wuthering Heights
768,"cash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the",Wuthering Heights
768,"mortgagee. In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first",Wuthering Heights
768,"gentleman in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete",Wuthering Heights
768,dependence on his father’s inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house,Wuthering Heights
768,"as a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right",Wuthering Heights
768,"himself, because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has",Wuthering Heights
768,been wronged.,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XVIII,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period",Wuthering Heights
768,were the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage,Wuthering Heights
768,"rose from our little lady’s trifling illnesses, which she had to",Wuthering Heights
768,"experience in common with all children, rich and poor. For the rest,",Wuthering Heights
768,"after the first six months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and",Wuthering Heights
768,"talk too, in her own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over",Wuthering Heights
768,Mrs. Linton’s dust. She was the most winning thing that ever brought,Wuthering Heights
768,"sunshine into a desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the",Wuthering Heights
768,"Earnshaws’ handsome dark eyes, but the Lintons’ fair skin and small",Wuthering Heights
768,"features, and yellow curling hair. Her spirit was high, though not",Wuthering Heights
768,"rough, and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its",Wuthering Heights
768,affections. That capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her,Wuthering Heights
768,mother: still she did not resemble her: for she could be soft and mild,Wuthering Heights
768,"as a dove, and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression: her anger",Wuthering Heights
768,was never furious; her love never fierce: it was deep and tender.,Wuthering Heights
768,"However, it must be acknowledged, she had faults to foil her gifts. A",Wuthering Heights
768,"propensity to be saucy was one; and a perverse will, that indulged",Wuthering Heights
768,"children invariably acquire, whether they be good tempered or cross. If",Wuthering Heights
768,"a servant chanced to vex her, it was always—“I shall tell papa!” And if",Wuthering Heights
768,"he reproved her, even by a look, you would have thought it a",Wuthering Heights
768,heart-breaking business: I don’t believe he ever did speak a harsh word,Wuthering Heights
768,"to her. He took her education entirely on himself, and made it an",Wuthering Heights
768,"amusement. Fortunately, curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt",Wuthering Heights
768,"scholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and did honour to his",Wuthering Heights
768,teaching.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the,Wuthering Heights
768,range of the park by herself. Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile,Wuthering Heights
768,"or so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only",Wuthering Heights
768,"building she had approached or entered, except her own home. Wuthering",Wuthering Heights
768,Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect,Wuthering Heights
768,"recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented. Sometimes, indeed, while",Wuthering Heights
768,"surveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those",Wuthering Heights
768,hills? I wonder what lies on the other side—is it the sea?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, Miss Cathy,” I would answer; “it is hills again, just like these.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?” she,Wuthering Heights
768,once asked.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her,Wuthering Heights
768,notice; especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost,Wuthering Heights
768,"heights, and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"explained that they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth",Wuthering Heights
768,in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?” she,Wuthering Heights
768,pursued.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,” replied I; “you",Wuthering Heights
768,"could not climb them, they are too high and steep. In winter the frost",Wuthering Heights
768,is always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have,Wuthering Heights
768,found snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, you have been on them!” she cried gleefully. “Then I can go, too,",Wuthering Heights
768,"when I am a woman. Has papa been, Ellen?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Papa would tell you, Miss,” I answered, hastily, “that they are not",Wuthering Heights
768,"worth the trouble of visiting. The moors, where you ramble with him,",Wuthering Heights
768,are much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But I know the park, and I don’t know those,” she murmured to herself.",Wuthering Heights
768,“And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest,Wuthering Heights
768,point: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her head with",Wuthering Heights
768,a desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he,Wuthering Heights
768,promised she should have the journey when she got older. But Miss,Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine measured her age by months, and, “Now, am I old enough to go",Wuthering Heights
768,to Penistone Crags?” was the constant question in her mouth. The road,Wuthering Heights
768,thither wound close by Wuthering Heights. Edgar had not the heart to,Wuthering Heights
768,"pass it; so she received as constantly the answer, “Not yet, love: not",Wuthering Heights
768,yet.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her,Wuthering Heights
768,husband. Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both,Wuthering Heights
768,lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.,Wuthering Heights
768,"What her last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of",Wuthering Heights
768,"the same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but",Wuthering Heights
768,"incurable, and rapidly consuming life towards the close. She wrote to",Wuthering Heights
768,inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months’,Wuthering Heights
768,"indisposition under which she had suffered, and entreated him to come",Wuthering Heights
768,"to her, if possible; for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid",Wuthering Heights
768,"him adieu, and deliver Linton safely into his hands. Her hope was that",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton might be left with him, as he had been with her: his father, she",Wuthering Heights
768,"would fain convince herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his",Wuthering Heights
768,maintenance or education. My master hesitated not a moment in complying,Wuthering Heights
768,"with her request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls,",Wuthering Heights
768,"he flew to answer this; commending Catherine to my peculiar vigilance,",Wuthering Heights
768,"in his absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of",Wuthering Heights
768,"the park, even under my escort: he did not calculate on her going",Wuthering Heights
768,unaccompanied.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He was away three weeks. The first day or two my charge sat in a corner,Wuthering Heights
768,"of the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet",Wuthering Heights
768,state she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval,Wuthering Heights
768,"of impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then,",Wuthering Heights
768,"to run up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might",Wuthering Heights
768,entertain herself. I used to send her on her travels round the,Wuthering Heights
768,"grounds—now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient",Wuthering Heights
768,audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this,Wuthering Heights
768,solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast,Wuthering Heights
768,till tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful,Wuthering Heights
768,tales. I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were,Wuthering Heights
768,"generally locked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone,",Wuthering Heights
768,"if they had stood wide open. Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o’clock, and said she was",Wuthering Heights
768,"that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his",Wuthering Heights
768,caravan; and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and,Wuthering Heights
768,"beasts: a horse, and three camels, personated by a large hound and a",Wuthering Heights
768,"couple of pointers. I got together good store of dainties, and slung",Wuthering Heights
768,them in a basket on one side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as,Wuthering Heights
768,"a fairy, sheltered by her wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July",Wuthering Heights
768,"sun, and trotted off with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to",Wuthering Heights
768,"avoid galloping, and come back early. The naughty thing never made her",Wuthering Heights
768,"appearance at tea. One traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond",Wuthering Heights
768,"of its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two",Wuthering Heights
768,pointers were visible in any direction: I despatched emissaries down,Wuthering Heights
768,"this path, and that path, and at last went wandering in search of her",Wuthering Heights
768,"myself. There was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on",Wuthering Heights
768,the borders of the grounds. I inquired of him if he had seen our young,Wuthering Heights
768,lady.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I saw her at morn,” he replied: “she would have me to cut her a hazel",Wuthering Heights
768,"switch, and then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it",Wuthering Heights
768,"is lowest, and galloped out of sight.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,You may guess how I felt at hearing this news. It struck me directly,Wuthering Heights
768,she must have started for Penistone Crags. “What will become of her?” I,Wuthering Heights
768,"ejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"making straight to the high-road. I walked as if for a wager, mile",Wuthering Heights
768,"after mile, till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no",Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine could I detect, far or near. The Crags lie about a mile and a",Wuthering Heights
768,"half beyond Mr. Heathcliff’s place, and that is four from the Grange,",Wuthering Heights
768,so I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach them. “And what,Wuthering Heights
768,"if she should have slipped in clambering among them,” I reflected, “and",Wuthering Heights
768,"been killed, or broken some of her bones?” My suspense was truly",Wuthering Heights
768,"painful; and, at first, it gave me delightful relief to observe, in",Wuthering Heights
768,"hurrying by the farmhouse, Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying",Wuthering Heights
768,"under a window, with swelled head and bleeding ear. I opened the wicket",Wuthering Heights
768,"and ran to the door, knocking vehemently for admittance. A woman whom I",Wuthering Heights
768,"knew, and who formerly lived at Gimmerton, answered: she had been",Wuthering Heights
768,servant there since the death of Mr. Earnshaw.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ah,” said she, “you are come a-seeking your little mistress! Don’t be",Wuthering Heights
768,frightened. She’s here safe: but I’m glad it isn’t the master.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He is not at home then, is he?” I panted, quite breathless with quick",Wuthering Heights
768,walking and alarm.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, no,” she replied: “both he and Joseph are off, and I think they",Wuthering Heights
768,won’t return this hour or more. Step in and rest you a bit.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking",Wuthering Heights
768,herself in a little chair that had been her mother’s when a child. Her,Wuthering Heights
768,"hat was hung against the wall, and she seemed perfectly at home,",Wuthering Heights
768,"laughing and chattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton—now",Wuthering Heights
768,"a great, strong lad of eighteen—who stared at her with considerable",Wuthering Heights
768,curiosity and astonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent,Wuthering Heights
768,succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased,Wuthering Heights
768,pouring forth.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Very well, Miss!” I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry",Wuthering Heights
768,"countenance. “This is your last ride, till papa comes back. I’ll not",Wuthering Heights
768,"trust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Aha, Ellen!” she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side. “I",Wuthering Heights
768,shall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you’ve found me out.,Wuthering Heights
768,Have you ever been here in your life before?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Put that hat on, and home at once,” said I. “I’m dreadfully grieved at",Wuthering Heights
768,"you, Miss Cathy: you’ve done extremely wrong! It’s no use pouting and",Wuthering Heights
768,"crying: that won’t repay the trouble I’ve had, scouring the country",Wuthering Heights
768,after you. To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you,Wuthering Heights
768,"stealing off so! It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will",Wuthering Heights
768,put faith in you any more.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What have I done?” sobbed she, instantly checked. “Papa charged me",Wuthering Heights
768,"nothing: he’ll not scold me, Ellen—he’s never cross, like you!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Come, come!” I repeated. “I’ll tie the riband. Now, let us have no",Wuthering Heights
768,"petulance. Oh, for shame! You thirteen years old, and such a baby!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"This exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and",Wuthering Heights
768,retreating to the chimney out of my reach.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nay,” said the servant, “don’t be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean.",Wuthering Heights
768,"We made her stop: she’d fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be",Wuthering Heights
768,"uneasy. Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he should: it’s a",Wuthering Heights
768,wild road over the hills.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets,",Wuthering Heights

768,intrusion.,Wuthering Heights

768,"“How long am I to wait?” I continued, disregarding the woman’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"interference. “It will be dark in ten minutes. Where is the pony, Miss",Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy? And where is Phoenix? I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so",Wuthering Heights
768,please yourself.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“The pony is in the yard,” she replied, “and Phoenix is shut in there.",Wuthering Heights
768,He’s bitten—and so is Charlie. I was going to tell you all about it;,Wuthering Heights
768,"but you are in a bad temper, and don’t deserve to hear.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving",Wuthering Heights
768,"that the people of the house took her part, she commenced capering",Wuthering Heights
768,"round the room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under",Wuthering Heights
768,"and behind the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton and the woman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more",Wuthering Heights
768,"impertinent still; till I cried, in great irritation,—“Well, Miss",Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy, if you were aware whose house this is you’d be glad enough to",Wuthering Heights
768,get out.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It’s _your_ father’s, isn’t it?” said she, turning to Hareton.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nay,” he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just",Wuthering Heights
768,his own.,Wuthering Heights

768,turned away.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Who is his master?” continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me. “He",Wuthering Heights
768,"talked about ‘our house,’ and ‘our folk.’ I thought he had been the",Wuthering Heights
768,"owner’s son. And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn’t he,",Wuthering Heights
768,if he’s a servant?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"silently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her",Wuthering Heights
768,for departure.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Now, get my horse,” she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she",Wuthering Heights
768,would one of the stable-boys at the Grange. “And you may come with me.,Wuthering Heights
768,"I want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear",Wuthering Heights
768,"about the _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste! What’s the",Wuthering Heights
768,"matter? Get my horse, I say.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“I’ll see thee damned before I be _thy_ servant!” growled the lad.,Wuthering Heights

768,"“There, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty company,” I",Wuthering Heights
768,interposed. “Nice words to be used to a young lady! Pray don’t begin to,Wuthering Heights
768,"dispute with him. Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But, Ellen,” cried she, staring fixed in astonishment, “how dare he",Wuthering Heights
768,speak so to me? Mustn’t he be made to do as I ask him? You wicked,Wuthering Heights
768,"creature, I shall tell papa what you said.—Now, then!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into,Wuthering Heights
768,"her eyes with indignation. “You bring the pony,” she exclaimed, turning",Wuthering Heights
768,"to the woman, “and let my dog free this moment!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Softly, Miss,” answered the addressed. “You’ll lose nothing by being",Wuthering Heights
768,"civil. Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master’s son, he’s your",Wuthering Heights
768,cousin: and I was never hired to serve you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“_He_ my cousin!” cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, indeed,” responded her reprover.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, Ellen! don’t let them say such things,” she pursued in great",Wuthering Heights
768,trouble. “Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a,Wuthering Heights
768,"gentleman’s son. That my—” she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the",Wuthering Heights
768,bare notion of relationship with such a clown.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hush, hush!” I whispered; “people can have many cousins and of all",Wuthering Heights

768,"needn’t keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He’s not—he’s not my cousin, Ellen!” she went on, gathering fresh",Wuthering Heights
768,"grief from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge",Wuthering Heights
768,from the idea.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations;,Wuthering Heights
768,"having no doubt of Linton’s approaching arrival, communicated by the",Wuthering Heights
768,"former, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that",Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine’s first thought on her father’s return would be to seek an,Wuthering Heights
768,explanation of the latter’s assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant,",Wuthering Heights
768,"seemed moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the",Wuthering Heights
768,"door, he took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp",Wuthering Heights
768,"from the kennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he",Wuthering Heights
768,"meant nought. Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a",Wuthering Heights
768,"glance of awe and horror, then burst forth anew.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor,Wuthering Heights
768,"fellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily",Wuthering Heights
768,occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after,Wuthering Heights
768,"rabbits and game. Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a",Wuthering Heights
768,mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed. Good,Wuthering Heights
768,"things lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far",Wuthering Heights
768,"over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a",Wuthering Heights
768,"wealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and",Wuthering Heights
768,"favourable circumstances. Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated",Wuthering Heights
768,"him physically ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no",Wuthering Heights
768,temptation to that course of oppression: he had none of the timid,Wuthering Heights
768,"susceptibility that would have given zest to ill-treatment, in",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff’s judgment. He appeared to have bent his malevolence on,Wuthering Heights
768,making him a brute: he was never taught to read or write; never rebuked,Wuthering Heights
768,for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper; never led a single,Wuthering Heights
768,"step towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept against vice. And",Wuthering Heights
768,"from what I heard, Joseph contributed much to his deterioration, by a",Wuthering Heights
768,"narrow-minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him, as",Wuthering Heights
768,"a boy, because he was the head of the old family. And as he had been in",Wuthering Heights
768,"the habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, when children,",Wuthering Heights
768,"of putting the master past his patience, and compelling him to seek",Wuthering Heights
768,"solace in drink by what he termed their “offald ways,” so at present he",Wuthering Heights
768,laid the whole burden of Hareton’s faults on the shoulders of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"usurper of his property. If the lad swore, he wouldn’t correct him: nor",Wuthering Heights
768,"however culpably he behaved. It gave Joseph satisfaction, apparently,",Wuthering Heights
768,to watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed that the lad was ruined:,Wuthering Heights
768,that his soul was abandoned to perdition; but then he reflected that,Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff must answer for it. Hareton’s blood would be required at his,Wuthering Heights
768,hands; and there lay immense consolation in that thought. Joseph had,Wuthering Heights
768,"instilled into him a pride of name, and of his lineage; he would, had",Wuthering Heights
768,"he dared, have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the",Wuthering Heights
768,Heights: but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition; and he,Wuthering Heights
768,confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private,Wuthering Heights
768,comminations. I don’t pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode,Wuthering Heights
768,of living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights: I only speak,Wuthering Heights
768,from hearsay; for I saw little. The villagers affirmed Mr. Heathcliff,Wuthering Heights
768,"was _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants; but the house,",Wuthering Heights
768,"inside, had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female",Wuthering Heights
768,"management, and the scenes of riot common in Hindley’s time were not",Wuthering Heights
768,now enacted within its walls. The master was too gloomy to seek,Wuthering Heights
768,"companionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"This, however, is not making progress with my story. Miss Cathy",Wuthering Heights
768,"rejected the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs,",Wuthering Heights
768,Charlie and Phoenix. They came limping and hanging their heads; and we,Wuthering Heights
768,"set out for home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us. I could not",Wuthering Heights
768,"wring from my little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I",Wuthering Heights
768,"supposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she",Wuthering Heights
768,"arrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse, when Hareton",Wuthering Heights
768,"happened to issue forth, attended by some canine followers, who",Wuthering Heights
768,"attacked her train. They had a smart battle, before their owners could",Wuthering Heights
768,separate them: that formed an introduction. Catherine told Hareton who,Wuthering Heights
768,"she was, and where she was going; and asked him to show her the way:",Wuthering Heights
768,"finally, beguiling him to accompany her. He opened the mysteries of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"Fairy Cave, and twenty other queer places. But, being in disgrace, I",Wuthering Heights
768,was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw.,Wuthering Heights
768,"I could gather, however, that her guide had been a favourite till she",Wuthering Heights
768,hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff’s,Wuthering Heights
768,housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin. Then the language he,Wuthering Heights
768,"had held to her rankled in her heart; she who was always “love,” and",Wuthering Heights
768,"“darling,” and “queen,” and “angel,” with everybody at the Grange, to",Wuthering Heights
768,be insulted so shockingly by a stranger! She did not comprehend it; and,Wuthering Heights
768,hard work I had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the,Wuthering Heights
768,grievance before her father. I explained how he objected to the whole,Wuthering Heights
768,"household at the Heights, and how sorry he would be to find she had",Wuthering Heights
768,"been there; but I insisted most on the fact, that if she revealed my",Wuthering Heights
768,"negligence of his orders, he would perhaps be so angry that I should",Wuthering Heights
768,have to leave; and Cathy couldn’t bear that prospect: she pledged her,Wuthering Heights
768,"word, and kept it for my sake. After all, she was a sweet little girl.",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master’s return.",Wuthering Heights
768,Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his,Wuthering Heights
768,"daughter, and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his",Wuthering Heights
768,youthful nephew. Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming,Wuthering Heights
768,her father back; and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the,Wuthering Heights
768,innumerable excellencies of her “real” cousin. The evening of their,Wuthering Heights
768,expected arrival came. Since early morning she had been busy ordering,Wuthering Heights
768,her own small affairs; and now attired in her new black frock—poor,Wuthering Heights
768,thing! her aunt’s death impressed her with no definite sorrow—she,Wuthering Heights
768,"obliged me, by constant worrying, to walk with her down through the",Wuthering Heights
768,grounds to meet them.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Linton is just six months younger than I am,” she chattered, as we",Wuthering Heights
768,"strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under",Wuthering Heights
768,shadow of the trees. “How delightful it will be to have him for a,Wuthering Heights
768,playfellow! Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it,Wuthering Heights
768,"was lighter than mine—more flaxen, and quite as fine. I have it",Wuthering Heights
768,carefully preserved in a little glass box; and I’ve often thought what,Wuthering Heights
768,"a pleasure it would be to see its owner. Oh! I am happy—and papa, dear,",Wuthering Heights
768,"dear papa! Come, Ellen, let us run! come, run.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober",Wuthering Heights
768,"footsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy",Wuthering Heights
768,"bank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was",Wuthering Heights
768,impossible: she couldn’t be still a minute.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“How long they are!” she exclaimed. “Ah, I see some dust on the",Wuthering Heights
768,road—they are coming! No! When will they be here? May we not go a,Wuthering Heights
768,"little way—half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile? Do say yes, to",Wuthering Heights
768,that clump of birches at the turn!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I refused staunchly. At length her suspense was ended: the travelling,Wuthering Heights
768,carriage rolled in sight. Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her,Wuthering Heights
768,arms as soon as she caught her father’s face looking from the window.,Wuthering Heights
768,"He descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval",Wuthering Heights
768,elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves. While,Wuthering Heights
768,they exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton. He was,Wuthering Heights
768,"asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had",Wuthering Heights
768,"been winter. A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been",Wuthering Heights
768,"taken for my master’s younger brother, so strong was the resemblance:",Wuthering Heights
768,but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton,Wuthering Heights
768,"never had. The latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised",Wuthering Heights
768,"me to close the door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had",Wuthering Heights
768,"fatigued him. Cathy would fain have taken one glance, but her father",Wuthering Heights
768,"told her to come, and they walked together up the park, while I",Wuthering Heights
768,hastened before to prepare the servants.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Now, darling,” said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they",Wuthering Heights
768,halted at the bottom of the front steps: “your cousin is not so strong,Wuthering Heights
768,"or so merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very",Wuthering Heights
768,"short time since; therefore, don’t expect him to play and run about",Wuthering Heights
768,with you directly. And don’t harass him much by talking: let him be,Wuthering Heights
768,"quiet this evening, at least, will you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, yes, papa,” answered Catherine: “but I do want to see him; and he",Wuthering Heights
768,hasn’t once looked out.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the",Wuthering Heights
768,ground by his uncle.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,” he said, putting their little",Wuthering Heights
768,hands together. “She’s fond of you already; and mind you don’t grieve,Wuthering Heights
768,her by crying to-night. Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an,Wuthering Heights
768,"end, and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you",Wuthering Heights
768,please.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Let me go to bed, then,” answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine’s",Wuthering Heights
768,salute; and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Come, come, there’s a good child,” I whispered, leading him in.",Wuthering Heights
768,“You’ll make her weep too—see how sorry she is for you!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as",Wuthering Heights
768,"sad a countenance as himself, and returned to her father. All three",Wuthering Heights
768,"entered, and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"proceeded to remove Linton’s cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair",Wuthering Heights
768,by the table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.,Wuthering Heights
768,My master inquired what was the matter.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I can’t sit on a chair,” sobbed the boy.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea,” answered",Wuthering Heights
768,his uncle patiently.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his",Wuthering Heights
768,"fretful ailing charge. Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down.",Wuthering Heights
768,Cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side. At first she sat,Wuthering Heights
768,silent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her,Wuthering Heights
768,"little cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking",Wuthering Heights
768,"his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer,",Wuthering Heights
768,"like a baby. This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his",Wuthering Heights
768,"eyes, and lightened into a faint smile.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, he’ll do very well,” said the master to me, after watching them a",Wuthering Heights
768,"minute. “Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen. The company of a child",Wuthering Heights
768,"of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for",Wuthering Heights
768,strength he’ll gain it.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ay, if we can keep him!” I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came",Wuthering Heights
768,"over me that there was slight hope of that. And then, I thought, how",Wuthering Heights
768,ever will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights? Between his father,Wuthering Heights
768,"and Hareton, what playmates and instructors they’ll be. Our doubts were",Wuthering Heights
768,presently decided—even earlier than I expected. I had just taken the,Wuthering Heights
768,"children upstairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep—he",Wuthering Heights
768,would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case—I had come,Wuthering Heights
768,"down, and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom",Wuthering Heights
768,"candle for Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and",Wuthering Heights
768,"informed me that Mr. Heathcliff’s servant Joseph was at the door, and",Wuthering Heights
768,wished to speak with the master.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I shall ask him what he wants first,” I said, in considerable",Wuthering Heights
768,"trepidation. “A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the",Wuthering Heights
768,instant they have returned from a long journey. I don’t think the,Wuthering Heights
768,master can see him.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and",Wuthering Heights
768,now presented himself in the hall. He was donned in his Sunday,Wuthering Heights
768,"garments, with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding",Wuthering Heights
768,"his hat in one hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean",Wuthering Heights
768,his shoes on the mat.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Good-evening, Joseph,” I said, coldly. “What business brings you here",Wuthering Heights
768,to-night?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It’s Maister Linton I mun spake to,” he answered, waving me",Wuthering Heights
768,disdainfully aside.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to,Wuthering Heights
768,"say, I’m sure he won’t hear it now,” I continued. “You had better sit",Wuthering Heights
768,"down in there, and entrust your message to me.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Which is his rahm?” pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed",Wuthering Heights
768,doors.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I",Wuthering Heights
768,"went up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor,",Wuthering Heights
768,advising that he should be dismissed till next day. Mr. Linton had no,Wuthering Heights
768,"time to empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"pushing into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"table, with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began",Wuthering Heights
768,"in an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn’t goa back ’bout him.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow,Wuthering Heights
768,overcast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own,Wuthering Heights
768,"account; but, recalling Isabella’s hopes and fears, and anxious wishes",Wuthering Heights
768,"for her son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved",Wuthering Heights
768,"bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart",Wuthering Heights
768,how it might be avoided. No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of,Wuthering Heights
768,any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more,Wuthering Heights
768,"peremptory: there was nothing left but to resign him. However, he was",Wuthering Heights
768,not going to rouse him from his sleep.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Tell Mr. Heathcliff,” he answered calmly, “that his son shall come to",Wuthering Heights
768,"Wuthering Heights to-morrow. He is in bed, and too tired to go the",Wuthering Heights
768,distance now. You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired,Wuthering Heights
768,"him to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is",Wuthering Heights
768,very precarious.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Noa!” said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and",Wuthering Heights
768,assuming an authoritative air. “Noa! that means naught. Hathecliff maks,Wuthering Heights
768,"noa ’count o’ t’ mother, nor ye norther; but he’ll hev his lad; und I",Wuthering Heights
768,mun tak’ him—soa now ye knaw!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“You shall not to-night!” answered Linton decisively. “Walk down stairs,Wuthering Heights
768,"at once, and repeat to your master what I have said. Ellen, show him",Wuthering Heights
768,down. Go—”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room",Wuthering Heights
768,of him and closed the door.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Varrah weell!” shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off. “To-morn, he’s",Wuthering Heights

768,"to visit the Heights. Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly,",Wuthering Heights
768,and he has been obliged to leave us.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o’clock,",Wuthering Heights
768,and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further,Wuthering Heights
768,travelling; but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going,Wuthering Heights
768,"to spend some time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see",Wuthering Heights
768,"him so much, he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should",Wuthering Heights
768,recover from his late journey.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“My father!” he cried, in strange perplexity. “Mamma never told me I",Wuthering Heights
768,had a father. Where does he live? I’d rather stay with uncle.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He lives a little distance from the Grange,” I replied; “just beyond",Wuthering Heights
768,"those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get",Wuthering Heights
768,"hearty. And you should be glad to go home, and to see him. You must try",Wuthering Heights
768,"to love him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“But why have I not heard of him before?” asked Linton. “Why didn’t,Wuthering Heights
768,"mamma and he live together, as other people do?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He had business to keep him in the north,” I answered, “and your",Wuthering Heights
768,mother’s health required her to reside in the south.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And why didn’t mamma speak to me about him?” persevered the child.,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago. How am I",Wuthering Heights
768,to love papa? I don’t know him.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, all children love their parents,” I said. “Your mother, perhaps,",Wuthering Heights
768,thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to,Wuthering Heights
768,you. Let us make haste. An early ride on such a beautiful morning is,Wuthering Heights
768,much preferable to an hour’s more sleep.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is _she_ to go with us,” he demanded, “the little girl I saw",Wuthering Heights
768,yesterday?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Not now,” replied I.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Is uncle?” he continued.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, I shall be your companion there,” I said.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I won’t go without uncle,” he cried at length: “I can’t tell where you",Wuthering Heights
768,mean to take me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to,Wuthering Heights
768,meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards,Wuthering Heights
768,"dressing, and I had to call for my master’s assistance in coaxing him",Wuthering Heights
768,"out of bed. The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive",Wuthering Heights
768,assurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy,Wuthering Heights
768,"would visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I",Wuthering Heights
768,invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way. The pure,Wuthering Heights
768,"heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of",Wuthering Heights
768,"Minny, relieved his despondency after a while. He began to put",Wuthering Heights
768,"questions concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater",Wuthering Heights
768,interest and liveliness.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?” he,Wuthering Heights
768,"inquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light",Wuthering Heights
768,mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is not so buried in trees,” I replied, “and it is not quite so",Wuthering Heights
768,"large, but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air",Wuthering Heights
768,"is healthier for you—fresher and drier. You will, perhaps, think the",Wuthering Heights
768,building old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the,Wuthering Heights
768,next best in the neighbourhood. And you will have such nice rambles on,Wuthering Heights
768,"the moors. Hareton Earnshaw—that is, Miss Cathy’s other cousin, and so",Wuthering Heights
768,yours in a manner—will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can,Wuthering Heights
768,"bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently,",Wuthering Heights
768,walk out on the hills.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And what is my father like?” he asked. “Is he as young and handsome as,Wuthering Heights
768,uncle?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He’s as young,” said I; “but he has black hair and eyes, and looks",Wuthering Heights
768,sterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether. He’ll not seem to you,Wuthering Heights
768,"so gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still,",Wuthering Heights
768,"mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he’ll be fonder",Wuthering Heights
768,"of you than any uncle, for you are his own.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Black hair and eyes!” mused Linton. “I can’t fancy him. Then I am not,Wuthering Heights
768,"like him, am I?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Not much,” I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret",Wuthering Heights
768,"the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large",Wuthering Heights
768,"languid eyes—his mother’s eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness",Wuthering Heights
768,"kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!” he,Wuthering Heights
768,"murmured. “Has he ever seen me? If he has, I must have been a baby. I",Wuthering Heights
768,remember not a single thing about him!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why, Master Linton,” said I, “three hundred miles is a great distance;",Wuthering Heights
768,and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person,Wuthering Heights
768,compared with what they do to you. It is probable Mr. Heathcliff,Wuthering Heights
768,"proposed going from summer to summer, but never found a convenient",Wuthering Heights
768,opportunity; and now it is too late. Don’t trouble him with questions,Wuthering Heights
768,"on the subject: it will disturb him, for no good.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder,Wuthering Heights
768,"of the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate. I watched",Wuthering Heights
768,to catch his impressions in his countenance. He surveyed the carved,Wuthering Heights
768,"front and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and",Wuthering Heights
768,"crooked firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his",Wuthering Heights
768,private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.,Wuthering Heights
768,But he had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation,Wuthering Heights
768,"within. Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door. It was",Wuthering Heights
768,half-past six; the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was,Wuthering Heights
768,clearing and wiping down the table. Joseph stood by his master’s chair,Wuthering Heights
768,telling some tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing,Wuthering Heights
768,for the hayfield.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hallo, Nelly!” said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me. “I feared I should",Wuthering Heights
768,"have to come down and fetch my property myself. You’ve brought it, have",Wuthering Heights
768,you? Let us see what we can make of it.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping,Wuthering Heights
768,curiosity. Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the,Wuthering Heights
768,three.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Sure-ly,” said Joseph after a grave inspection, “he’s swopped wi’ ye,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Maister, an’ yon’s his lass!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a",Wuthering Heights
768,scornful laugh.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!” he exclaimed.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hav’n’t they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly? Oh, damn my",Wuthering Heights
768,soul! but that’s worse than I expected—and the devil knows I was not,Wuthering Heights
768,sanguine!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter. He did",Wuthering Heights
768,"not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father’s speech, or",Wuthering Heights
768,"whether it were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that",Wuthering Heights
768,"the grim, sneering stranger was his father. But he clung to me with",Wuthering Heights
768,growing trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff’s taking a seat and bidding,Wuthering Heights
768,him “come hither” he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Tut, tut!” said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him",Wuthering Heights
768,"roughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“None of that nonsense! We’re not going to hurt thee, Linton—isn’t that",Wuthering Heights
768,"thy name? Thou art thy mother’s child, entirely! Where is _my_ share in",Wuthering Heights
768,"thee, puling chicken?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He took off the boy’s cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt",Wuthering Heights
768,his slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton,Wuthering Heights
768,"ceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Do you know me?” asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the",Wuthering Heights
768,limbs were all equally frail and feeble.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’ve heard of me, I daresay?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” he replied again.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No! What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for",Wuthering Heights
768,"me! You are my son, then, I’ll tell you; and your mother was a wicked",Wuthering Heights
768,slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Now, don’t wince, and colour up! Though it _is_ something to see you",Wuthering Heights
768,"have not white blood. Be a good lad; and I’ll do for you. Nelly, if you",Wuthering Heights
768,"be tired you may sit down; if not, get home again. I guess you’ll",Wuthering Heights
768,report what you hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this,Wuthering Heights
768,thing won’t be settled while you linger about it.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well,” replied I, “I hope you’ll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff,",Wuthering Heights
768,or you’ll not keep him long; and he’s all you have akin in the wide,Wuthering Heights
768,"world, that you will ever know—remember.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ll be _very_ kind to him, you needn’t fear,” he said, laughing.",Wuthering Heights
768,“Only nobody else must be kind to him: I’m jealous of monopolising his,Wuthering Heights
768,"affection. And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some",Wuthering Heights
768,"breakfast. Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work. Yes, Nell,”",Wuthering Heights
768,"he added, when they had departed, “my son is prospective owner of your",Wuthering Heights
768,"place, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his",Wuthering Heights
768,"successor. Besides, he’s _mine_, and I want the triumph of seeing _my_",Wuthering Heights
768,descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children,Wuthering Heights
768,to till their fathers’ lands for wages. That is the sole consideration,Wuthering Heights
768,"which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate",Wuthering Heights
768,him for the memories he revives! But that consideration is sufficient:,Wuthering Heights
768,"he’s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master",Wuthering Heights
768,"tends his own. I have a room upstairs, furnished for him in handsome",Wuthering Heights
768,"style; I’ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from",Wuthering Heights
768,"twenty miles’ distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn. I’ve",Wuthering Heights
768,ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I’ve arranged everything with,Wuthering Heights
768,"a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his",Wuthering Heights
768,"associates. I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the",Wuthering Heights
768,"trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a",Wuthering Heights
768,worthy object of pride; and I’m bitterly disappointed with the,Wuthering Heights
768,"whey-faced, whining wretch!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of",Wuthering Heights
768,"milk-porridge, and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the",Wuthering Heights
768,"homely mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it.",Wuthering Heights
768,I saw the old man-servant shared largely in his master’s scorn of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"child; though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart,",Wuthering Heights
768,because Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Cannot ate it?” repeated he, peering in Linton’s face, and subduing",Wuthering Heights
768,"his voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard. “But Maister",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little ’un; and what wer",Wuthering Heights
768,"gooid eneugh for him’s gooid eneugh for ye, I’s rayther think!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I _sha’n’t_ eat it!” answered Linton, snappishly. “Take it away.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is there aught ails th’ victuals?” he asked, thrusting the tray under",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff’s nose.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What should ail them?” he said.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Wah!” answered Joseph, “yon dainty chap says he cannut ate ’em. But I",Wuthering Heights
768,guess it’s raight! His mother wer just soa—we wer a’most too mucky to,Wuthering Heights
768,sow t’ corn for makking her breead.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Don’t mention his mother to me,” said the master, angrily. “Get him",Wuthering Heights
768,"something that he can eat, that’s all. What is his usual food, Nelly?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received,Wuthering Heights
768,"instructions to prepare some. Come, I reflected, his father’s",Wuthering Heights
768,selfishness may contribute to his comfort. He perceives his delicate,Wuthering Heights
768,"constitution, and the necessity of treating him tolerably. I’ll console",Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff’s humour has,Wuthering Heights
768,"taken. Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while",Wuthering Heights
768,Linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly,Wuthering Heights
768,sheep-dog. But he was too much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed,Wuthering Heights
768,"the door, I heard a cry, and a frantic repetition of the words—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Don’t leave me! I’ll not stay here! I’ll not stay here!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come,Wuthering Heights
768,"forth. I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief",Wuthering Heights
768,guardianship ended.,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XXI,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"We had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee,",Wuthering Heights
768,"eager to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations",Wuthering Heights
768,followed the news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to,Wuthering Heights
768,"soothe her, by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however,",Wuthering Heights
768,“if I can get him”; and there were no hopes of that. This promise,Wuthering Heights
768,poorly pacified her; but time was more potent; and though still at,Wuthering Heights
768,"intervals she inquired of her father when Linton would return, before",Wuthering Heights
768,she did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that,Wuthering Heights
768,she did not recognise him.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in",Wuthering Heights
768,"paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master",Wuthering Heights
768,"got on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was",Wuthering Heights
768,never to be seen. I could gather from her that he continued in weak,Wuthering Heights
768,"health, and was a tiresome inmate. She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to",Wuthering Heights
768,"dislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to",Wuthering Heights
768,"conceal it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could",Wuthering Heights
768,not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes,Wuthering Heights
768,together. There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his,Wuthering Heights
768,lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the,Wuthering Heights
768,parlour: or else lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting,Wuthering Heights
768,"coughs, and colds, and aches, and pains of some sort.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And I never knew such a faint-hearted creature,” added the woman; “nor",Wuthering Heights
768,"one so careful of hisseln. He _will_ go on, if I leave the window open",Wuthering Heights
768,"a bit late in the evening. Oh! it’s killing, a breath of night air! And",Wuthering Heights
768,he must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph’s bacca-pipe is,Wuthering Heights
768,"poison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk,",Wuthering Heights
768,milk for ever—heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter;,Wuthering Heights
768,"and there he’ll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the",Wuthering Heights
768,"fire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him—Hareton is not bad-natured,",Wuthering Heights
768,"though he’s rough—they’re sure to part, one swearing and the other",Wuthering Heights
768,crying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw’s thrashing him to a,Wuthering Heights
768,"mummy, if he were not his son; and I’m certain he would be fit to turn",Wuthering Heights
768,"him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But",Wuthering Heights
768,then he won’t go into danger of temptation: he never enters the,Wuthering Heights
768,"parlour, and should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he",Wuthering Heights
768,sends him upstairs directly.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered",Wuthering Heights
768,"young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so",Wuthering Heights
768,"originally; and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still",Wuthering Heights
768,"I was moved with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had",Wuthering Heights
768,been left with us. Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he,Wuthering Heights
768,"thought a great deal about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk",Wuthering Heights
768,to see him; and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever,Wuthering Heights
768,"came into the village? She said he had only been twice, on horseback,",Wuthering Heights
768,accompanying his father; and both times he pretended to be quite,Wuthering Heights
768,"knocked up for three or four days afterwards. That housekeeper left, if",Wuthering Heights
768,"I recollect rightly, two years after he came; and another, whom I did",Wuthering Heights
768,"not know, was her successor; she lives there still.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy,Wuthering Heights
768,reached sixteen. On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested,Wuthering Heights
768,"any signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late",Wuthering Heights
768,mistress’s death. Her father invariably spent that day alone in the,Wuthering Heights
768,"library; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he",Wuthering Heights
768,would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight. Therefore Catherine,Wuthering Heights
768,was thrown on her own resources for amusement. This twentieth of March,Wuthering Heights
768,"was a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young",Wuthering Heights
768,"lady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a",Wuthering Heights
768,"ramble on the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave,",Wuthering Heights
768,if we went only a short distance and were back within the hour.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“So make haste, Ellen!” she cried. “I know where I wish to go; where a",Wuthering Heights
768,colony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made,Wuthering Heights
768,their nests yet.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“That must be a good distance up,” I answered; “they don’t breed on the",Wuthering Heights
768,edge of the moor.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, it’s not,” she said. “I’ve gone very near with papa.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"matter. She bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off",Wuthering Heights
768,"again like a young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of",Wuthering Heights
768,"entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and watching her, my pet and my",Wuthering Heights
768,"delight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright",Wuthering Heights
768,"cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes",Wuthering Heights
768,"radiant with cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature, and an",Wuthering Heights
768,"angel, in those days. It’s a pity she could not be content.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well,” said I, “where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy? We should be at",Wuthering Heights
768,them: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, a little further—only a little further, Ellen,” was her answer,",Wuthering Heights
768,"continually. “Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time",Wuthering Heights
768,you reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at",Wuthering Heights
768,"length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our",Wuthering Heights
768,"steps. I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she",Wuthering Heights
768,"either did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"was compelled to follow. Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I",Wuthering Heights
768,"came in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights",Wuthering Heights
768,"than her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of",Wuthering Heights
768,whom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting",Wuthering Heights
768,"out the nests of the grouse. The Heights were Heathcliff’s land, and he",Wuthering Heights
768,was reproving the poacher.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ve neither taken any nor found any,” she said, as I toiled to them,",Wuthering Heights
768,expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement. “I didn’t mean,Wuthering Heights
768,"to take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,wished to see the eggs.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his",Wuthering Heights
768,"acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards",Wuthering Heights
768,"it, and demanded who “papa” was?",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,” she replied. “I thought you did not",Wuthering Heights
768,"know me, or you wouldn’t have spoken in that way.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?” he said,",Wuthering Heights
768,sarcastically.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And what are you?” inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the",Wuthering Heights
768,speaker. “That man I’ve seen before. Is he your son?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing",Wuthering Heights
768,but increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his,Wuthering Heights
768,age: he seemed as awkward and rough as ever.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Miss Cathy,” I interrupted, “it will be three hours instead of one",Wuthering Heights
768,"that we are out, presently. We really must go back.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, that man is not my son,” answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“But I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your",Wuthering Heights
768,"nurse is in a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a",Wuthering Heights
768,"little rest. Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my",Wuthering Heights
768,house? You’ll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a,Wuthering Heights
768,kind welcome.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I whispered Catherine that she mustn’t, on any account, accede to the",Wuthering Heights
768,proposal: it was entirely out of the question.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why?” she asked, aloud. “I’m tired of running, and the ground is dewy:",Wuthering Heights
768,"I can’t sit here. Let us go, Ellen. Besides, he says I have seen his",Wuthering Heights
768,"son. He’s mistaken, I think; but I guess where he lives: at the",Wuthering Heights
768,farmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags. Don’t you?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I do. Come, Nelly, hold your tongue—it will be a treat for her to look",Wuthering Heights
768,"in on us. Hareton, get forwards with the lass. You shall walk with me,",Wuthering Heights
768,Nelly.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, she’s not going to any such place,” I cried, struggling to release",Wuthering Heights
768,"my arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones",Wuthering Heights
768,"already, scampering round the brow at full speed. Her appointed",Wuthering Heights
768,"companion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side,",Wuthering Heights
768,and vanished.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mr. Heathcliff, it’s very wrong,” I continued: “you know you mean no",Wuthering Heights
768,"good. And there she’ll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever",Wuthering Heights
768,we return; and I shall have the blame.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I want her to see Linton,” he answered; “he’s looking better these few",Wuthering Heights
768,days; it’s not often he’s fit to be seen. And we’ll soon persuade her,Wuthering Heights
768,to keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“The harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found I",Wuthering Heights
768,suffered her to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad,Wuthering Heights
768,"design in encouraging her to do so,” I replied.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“My design is as honest as possible. I’ll inform you of its whole,Wuthering Heights
768,"scope,” he said. “That the two cousins may fall in love, and get",Wuthering Heights
768,married. I’m acting generously to your master: his young chit has no,Wuthering Heights
768,"expectations, and should she second my wishes she’ll be provided for at",Wuthering Heights
768,once as joint successor with Linton.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“If Linton died,” I answered, “and his life is quite uncertain,",Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine would be the heir.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, she would not,” he said. “There is no clause in the will to secure",Wuthering Heights
768,"it so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire",Wuthering Heights
768,"their union, and am resolved to bring it about.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And I’m resolved she shall never approach your house with me again,” I",Wuthering Heights
768,"returned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to",Wuthering Heights
768,"open the door. My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could",Wuthering Heights
768,not exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled,Wuthering Heights
768,"when he met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I",Wuthering Heights
768,was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him,Wuthering Heights
768,from desiring her injury. Linton stood on the hearth. He had been out,Wuthering Heights
768,"walking in the fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph",Wuthering Heights
768,"to bring him dry shoes. He had grown tall of his age, still wanting",Wuthering Heights
768,"some months of sixteen. His features were pretty yet, and his eye and",Wuthering Heights
768,"complexion brighter than I remembered them, though with merely",Wuthering Heights
768,temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Now, who is that?” asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy. “Can you",Wuthering Heights
768,tell?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Your son?” she said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then",Wuthering Heights
768,the other.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, yes,” answered he: “but is this the only time you have beheld",Wuthering Heights
768,"him? Think! Ah! you have a short memory. Linton, don’t you recall your",Wuthering Heights
768,"cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What, Linton!” cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name.",Wuthering Heights
768,“Is that little Linton? He’s taller than I am! Are you Linton?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him",Wuthering Heights
768,"fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in",Wuthering Heights
768,the appearance of each. Catherine had reached her full height; her,Wuthering Heights
768,"figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole",Wuthering Heights
768,aspect sparkling with health and spirits. Linton’s looks and movements,Wuthering Heights
768,"were very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace",Wuthering Heights
768,"in his manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not",Wuthering Heights
768,"unpleasing. After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his",Wuthering Heights
768,"cousin went to Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his",Wuthering Heights
768,attention between the objects inside and those that lay without:,Wuthering Heights
768,"pretending, that is, to observe the latter, and really noting the",Wuthering Heights
768,former alone.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And you are my uncle, then!” she cried, reaching up to salute him. “I",Wuthering Heights
768,"thought I liked you, though you were cross at first. Why don’t you",Wuthering Heights
768,visit at the Grange with Linton? To live all these years such close,Wuthering Heights
768,"neighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,” he",Wuthering Heights
768,"answered. “There—damn it! If you have any kisses to spare, give them to",Wuthering Heights
768,Linton: they are thrown away on me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Naughty Ellen!” exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her",Wuthering Heights
768,lavish caresses. “Wicked Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering. But,Wuthering Heights
768,"I’ll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and",Wuthering Heights
768,sometimes bring papa. Won’t you be glad to see us?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Of course,” replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace,",Wuthering Heights
768,resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors. “But,Wuthering Heights
768,"stay,” he continued, turning towards the young lady. “Now I think of",Wuthering Heights
768,"it, I’d better tell you. Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we",Wuthering Heights
768,"quarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if",Wuthering Heights
768,"you mention coming here to him, he’ll put a veto on your visits",Wuthering Heights
768,"altogether. Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless",Wuthering Heights
768,"of seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you",Wuthering Heights
768,must not mention it.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why did you quarrel?” asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He thought me too poor to wed his sister,” answered Heathcliff, “and",Wuthering Heights
768,"was grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he’ll never forgive",Wuthering Heights
768,it.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“That’s wrong!” said the young lady: “some time I’ll tell him so. But,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton and I have no share in your quarrel. I’ll not come here, then;",Wuthering Heights
768,he shall come to the Grange.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It will be too far for me,” murmured her cousin: “to walk four miles",Wuthering Heights
768,"would kill me. No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every",Wuthering Heights
768,"morning, but once or twice a week.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,” he muttered to me. “Miss",Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine, as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send",Wuthering Heights
768,"him to the devil. Now, if it had been Hareton!—Do you know that, twenty",Wuthering Heights
768,"times a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation? I’d have loved",Wuthering Heights
768,the lad had he been some one else. But I think he’s safe from _her_,Wuthering Heights
768,"love. I’ll pit him against that paltry creature, unless it bestir",Wuthering Heights
768,itself briskly. We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Oh, confound the vapid thing! He’s absorbed in drying his feet, and",Wuthering Heights
768,never looks at her.—Linton!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, father,” answered the boy.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit",Wuthering Heights
768,"or a weasel’s nest? Take her into the garden, before you change your",Wuthering Heights
768,shoes; and into the stable to see your horse.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Wouldn’t you rather sit here?” asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a",Wuthering Heights
768,tone which expressed reluctance to move again.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I don’t know,” she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and",Wuthering Heights
768,evidently eager to be active.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire. Heathcliff rose, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"went into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton. Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered. The young",Wuthering Heights
768,"man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks",Wuthering Heights
768,and his wetted hair.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, I’ll ask _you_, uncle,” cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the",Wuthering Heights
768,"housekeeper’s assertion. “That is not my cousin, is he?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes,” he replied, “your mother’s nephew. Don’t you like him?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine looked queer.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Is he not a handsome lad?” he continued.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff’s ear. He laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he was very,Wuthering Heights
768,"sensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his",Wuthering Heights
768,inferiority. But his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming—,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’ll be the favourite among us, Hareton! She says you are a—What was",Wuthering Heights
768,"it? Well, something very flattering. Here! you go with her round the",Wuthering Heights
768,"farm. And behave like a gentleman, mind! Don’t use any bad words; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"don’t stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to",Wuthering Heights
768,"hide your face when she is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and keep your hands out of your pockets. Be off, and entertain her as",Wuthering Heights
768,nicely as you can.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He watched the couple walking past the window. Earnshaw had his,Wuthering Heights
768,countenance completely averted from his companion. He seemed studying,Wuthering Heights
768,the familiar landscape with a stranger’s and an artist’s interest.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration. She then",Wuthering Heights
768,"turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of",Wuthering Heights
768,conversation.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ve tied his tongue,” observed Heathcliff. “He’ll not venture a",Wuthering Heights
768,"single syllable all the time! Nelly, you recollect me at his age—nay,",Wuthering Heights
768,"some years younger. Did I ever look so stupid: so ‘gaumless,’ as Joseph",Wuthering Heights
768,calls it?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Worse,” I replied, “because more sullen with it.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ve a pleasure in him,” he continued, reflecting aloud. “He has",Wuthering Heights
768,satisfied my expectations. If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it,Wuthering Heights
768,half so much. But he’s no fool; and I can sympathise with all his,Wuthering Heights
768,"feelings, having felt them myself. I know what he suffers now, for",Wuthering Heights
768,"instance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer,",Wuthering Heights
768,though. And he’ll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness,Wuthering Heights
768,and ignorance. I’ve got him faster than his scoundrel of a father,Wuthering Heights
768,"secured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness. I’ve",Wuthering Heights
768,taught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak. Don’t,Wuthering Heights
768,"you think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him?",Wuthering Heights
768,almost as proud as I am of mine. But there’s this difference; one is,Wuthering Heights
768,"gold put to the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to",Wuthering Heights
768,ape a service of silver. _Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I,Wuthering Heights
768,shall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go.,Wuthering Heights
768,"_His_ had first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than",Wuthering Heights
768,"unavailing. _I_ have nothing to regret; _he_ would have more than any,",Wuthering Heights
768,"but I, are aware of. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of",Wuthering Heights
768,me! You’ll own that I’ve outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain,Wuthering Heights
768,"could rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring’s wrongs, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again,",Wuthering Heights
768,indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the,Wuthering Heights
768,world!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea. I made no reply,",Wuthering Heights
768,"because I saw that he expected none. Meantime, our young companion, who",Wuthering Heights
768,"sat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms",Wuthering Heights
768,"of uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat",Wuthering Heights
768,of Catherine’s society for fear of a little fatigue. His father,Wuthering Heights
768,"remarked the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand",Wuthering Heights
768,irresolutely extended towards his cap.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Get up, you idle boy!” he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness. “Away",Wuthering Heights
768,"after them! they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton gathered his energies, and left the hearth. The lattice was",Wuthering Heights
768,"open, and, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable",Wuthering Heights
768,"attendant what was that inscription over the door? Hareton stared up,",Wuthering Heights
768,and scratched his head like a true clown.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It’s some damnable writing,” he answered. “I cannot read it.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Can’t read it?” cried Catherine; “I can read it: it’s English. But I,Wuthering Heights
768,want to know why it is there.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Linton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He does not know his letters,” he said to his cousin. “Could you",Wuthering Heights
768,believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is he all as he should be?” asked Miss Cathy, seriously; “or is he",Wuthering Heights
768,"simple: not right? I’ve questioned him twice now, and each time he",Wuthering Heights
768,looked so stupid I think he does not understand me. I can hardly,Wuthering Heights
768,"understand _him_, I’m sure!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who",Wuthering Heights
768,certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There’s nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?” he said.",Wuthering Heights
768,“My cousin fancies you are an idiot. There you experience the,Wuthering Heights
768,"consequence of scorning ‘book-larning,’ as you would say. Have you",Wuthering Heights
768,"noticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why, where the devil is the use on’t?” growled Hareton, more ready in",Wuthering Heights
768,"answering his daily companion. He was about to enlarge further, but the",Wuthering Heights
768,two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being,Wuthering Heights
768,delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of,Wuthering Heights
768,amusement.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?” tittered Linton.,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Papa told you not to say any bad words, and you can’t open your mouth",Wuthering Heights
768,"without one. Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“If thou weren’t more a lass than a lad, I’d fell thee this minute, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"would; pitiful lath of a crater!” retorted the angry boor, retreating,",Wuthering Heights
768,while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification; for he was,Wuthering Heights
768,"conscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled",Wuthering Heights
768,when he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular,Wuthering Heights
768,"aversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the doorway:",Wuthering Heights
768,the boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton’s faults and,Wuthering Heights
768,"deficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl",Wuthering Heights
768,"relishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the",Wuthering Heights
768,"ill-nature they evinced. I began to dislike, more than to compassionate",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton, and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,We stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but,Wuthering Heights
768,"happily my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant",Wuthering Heights
768,"of our prolonged absence. As we walked home, I would fain have",Wuthering Heights
768,enlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted:,Wuthering Heights
768,but she got it into her head that I was prejudiced against them.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Aha!” she cried, “you take papa’s side, Ellen: you are partial I know;",Wuthering Heights
768,or else you wouldn’t have cheated me so many years into the notion that,Wuthering Heights
768,Linton lived a long way from here. I’m really extremely angry; only I’m,Wuthering Heights
768,so pleased I can’t show it! But you must hold your tongue about my,Wuthering Heights
768,"uncle; he’s _my_ uncle, remember; and I’ll scold papa for quarrelling",Wuthering Heights
768,with him.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"And so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of",Wuthering Heights
768,"her mistake. She did not mention the visit that night, because she did",Wuthering Heights
768,"not see Mr. Linton. Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and",Wuthering Heights
768,still I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and,Wuthering Heights
768,warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me. But he was too,Wuthering Heights
768,timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun,Wuthering Heights
768,"connection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good",Wuthering Heights
768,reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Papa!” she exclaimed, after the morning’s salutations, “guess whom I",Wuthering Heights
768,"saw yesterday, in my walk on the moors. Ah, papa, you started! you’ve",Wuthering Heights
768,"not done right, have you, now? I saw—but listen, and you shall hear how",Wuthering Heights
768,"I found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet",Wuthering Heights
768,"pretended to pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always",Wuthering Heights
768,disappointed about Linton’s coming back!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,She gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and,Wuthering Heights
768,"my master, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said",Wuthering Heights
768,"nothing till she had concluded. Then he drew her to him, and asked if",Wuthering Heights
768,she knew why he had concealed Linton’s near neighbourhood from her?,Wuthering Heights
768,Could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly,Wuthering Heights
768,enjoy?,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,” she answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?”",Wuthering Heights
768,"he said. “No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because",Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to",Wuthering Heights
768,"wrong and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest",Wuthering Heights
768,opportunity. I knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with,Wuthering Heights
768,your cousin without being brought into contact with him; and I knew he,Wuthering Heights
768,"would detest you on my account; so for your own good, and nothing else,",Wuthering Heights
768,I took precautions that you should not see Linton again. I meant to,Wuthering Heights
768,"explain this some time as you grew older, and I’m sorry I delayed it.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,” observed Catherine, not",Wuthering Heights
768,at all convinced; “and _he_ didn’t object to our seeing each other: he,Wuthering Heights
768,said I might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell,Wuthering Heights
768,"you, because you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for",Wuthering Heights
768,marrying aunt Isabella. And you won’t. _You_ are the one to be blamed:,Wuthering Heights
768,"he is willing to let _us_ be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you",Wuthering Heights
768,are not.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her",Wuthering Heights
768,"uncle-in-law’s evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to",Wuthering Heights
768,"Isabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his",Wuthering Heights
768,property. He could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for,Wuthering Heights
768,"though he spoke little of it, he still felt the same horror and",Wuthering Heights
768,detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mrs. Linton’s death. “She might have been living yet, if it had not",Wuthering Heights
768,"been for him!” was his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes,",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff seemed a murderer. Miss Cathy—conversant with no bad deeds,Wuthering Heights
768,"except her own slight acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion,",Wuthering Heights
768,"arising from hot temper and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day",Wuthering Heights
768,they were committed—was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could,Wuthering Heights
768,"brood on and cover revenge for years, and deliberately prosecute its",Wuthering Heights
768,plans without a visitation of remorse. She appeared so deeply impressed,Wuthering Heights
768,and shocked at this new view of human nature—excluded from all her,Wuthering Heights
768,studies and all her ideas till now—that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary,Wuthering Heights
768,"to pursue the subject. He merely added: “You will know hereafter,",Wuthering Heights
768,"darling, why I wish you to avoid his house and family; now return to",Wuthering Heights
768,"your old employments and amusements, and think no more about them.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her lessons for a",Wuthering Heights
768,"couple of hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the",Wuthering Heights
768,"grounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when",Wuthering Heights
768,"she had retired to her room, and I went to help her to undress, I found",Wuthering Heights
768,"her crying, on her knees by the bedside.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, fie, silly child!” I exclaimed. “If you had any real griefs you’d",Wuthering Heights
768,be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety. You never had,Wuthering Heights
768,"one shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine. Suppose, for a",Wuthering Heights
768,"minute, that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the",Wuthering Heights
768,"world: how would you feel, then? Compare the present occasion with such",Wuthering Heights
768,"an affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have,",Wuthering Heights
768,instead of coveting more.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m not crying for myself, Ellen,” she answered, “it’s for him. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"expected to see me again to-morrow, and there he’ll be so disappointed:",Wuthering Heights
768,"and he’ll wait for me, and I sha’n’t come!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nonsense!” said I, “do you imagine he has thought as much of you as",Wuthering Heights
768,you have of him? Hasn’t he Hareton for a companion? Not one in a,Wuthering Heights
768,"hundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for",Wuthering Heights
768,"two afternoons. Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself",Wuthering Heights
768,no further about you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?” she asked,",Wuthering Heights
768,rising to her feet. “And just send those books I promised to lend him?,Wuthering Heights
768,"His books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them",Wuthering Heights
768,"extremely, when I told him how interesting they were. May I not,",Wuthering Heights
768,Ellen?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, indeed! no, indeed!” replied I with decision. “Then he would write",Wuthering Heights
768,"to you, and there’d never be an end of it. No, Miss Catherine, the",Wuthering Heights
768,"acquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see",Wuthering Heights
768,that it is done.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But how can one little note—?” she recommenced, putting on an",Wuthering Heights
768,imploring countenance.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Silence!” I interrupted. “We’ll not begin with your little notes. Get,Wuthering Heights
768,into bed.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss",Wuthering Heights
768,"her good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great",Wuthering Heights
768,"displeasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo! there",Wuthering Heights
768,was Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and,Wuthering Heights
768,"a pencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my",Wuthering Heights
768,entrance.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’ll get nobody to take that, Catherine,” I said, “if you write it;",Wuthering Heights
768,and at present I shall put out your candle.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my",Wuthering Heights
768,"hand and a petulant “cross thing!” I then quitted her again, and she",Wuthering Heights
768,"drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours. The letter was",Wuthering Heights
768,finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came,Wuthering Heights
768,from the village; but that I didn’t learn till some time afterwards.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Weeks passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew",Wuthering Heights
768,"wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself; and often, if I",Wuthering Heights
768,"came near her suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the",Wuthering Heights
768,"book, evidently desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose",Wuthering Heights
768,paper sticking out beyond the leaves. She also got a trick of coming,Wuthering Heights
768,"down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she",Wuthering Heights
768,were expecting the arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in,Wuthering Heights
768,"a cabinet in the library, which she would trifle over for hours, and",Wuthering Heights
768,whose key she took special care to remove when she left it.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings",Wuthering Heights
768,and trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into,Wuthering Heights
768,bits of folded paper. My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I,Wuthering Heights
768,"determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as",Wuthering Heights
768,"soon as she and my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily",Wuthering Heights
768,"found among my house keys one that would fit the lock. Having opened, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"emptied the whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to",Wuthering Heights
768,"examine at leisure in my own chamber. Though I could not but suspect, I",Wuthering Heights
768,was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of,Wuthering Heights
768,"correspondence—daily almost, it must have been—from Linton Heathcliff:",Wuthering Heights
768,answers to documents forwarded by her. The earlier dated were,Wuthering Heights
768,"embarrassed and short; gradually, however, they expanded into copious",Wuthering Heights
768,"love-letters, foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet",Wuthering Heights
768,with touches here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more,Wuthering Heights
768,experienced source. Some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds,Wuthering Heights
768,"of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong feeling, and concluding in",Wuthering Heights
768,"the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied,",Wuthering Heights
768,incorporeal sweetheart. Whether they satisfied Cathy I don’t know; but,Wuthering Heights
768,they appeared very worthless trash to me. After turning over as many as,Wuthering Heights
768,"I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside,",Wuthering Heights
768,relocking the vacant drawer.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the",Wuthering Heights
768,"kitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain",Wuthering Heights
768,"little boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked",Wuthering Heights
768,"something into his jacket pocket, and plucked something out. I went",Wuthering Heights
768,"round by the garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought",Wuthering Heights
768,"valorously to defend his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I",Wuthering Heights
768,"succeeded in abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious",Wuthering Heights
768,"consequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under the wall",Wuthering Heights
768,and perused Miss Cathy’s affectionate composition. It was more simple,Wuthering Heights
768,and more eloquent than her cousin’s: very pretty and very silly. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"shook my head, and went meditating into the house. The day being wet,",Wuthering Heights
768,"she could not divert herself with rambling about the park; so, at the",Wuthering Heights
768,"conclusion of her morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"drawer. Her father sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had",Wuthering Heights
768,"sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window-curtain,",Wuthering Heights
768,keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings. Never did any bird,Wuthering Heights
768,"flying back to a plundered nest, which it had left brimful of chirping",Wuthering Heights
768,"young ones, express more complete despair, in its anguished cries and",Wuthering Heights
768,"flutterings, than she by her single “Oh!” and the change that",Wuthering Heights
768,transfigured her late happy countenance. Mr. Linton looked up.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What is the matter, love? Have you hurt yourself?” he said.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,His tone and look assured her _he_ had not been the discoverer of the,Wuthering Heights
768,hoard.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, papa!” she gasped. “Ellen! Ellen! come upstairs—I’m sick!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, Ellen! you have got them,” she commenced immediately, dropping on",Wuthering Heights
768,"her knees, when we were enclosed alone. “Oh, give them to me, and I’ll",Wuthering Heights
768,"never, never do so again! Don’t tell papa. You have not told papa,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Ellen? say you have not? I’ve been exceedingly naughty, but I won’t do",Wuthering Heights
768,it any more!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,With a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“So,” I exclaimed, “Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems:",Wuthering Heights
768,you may well be ashamed of them! A fine bundle of trash you study in,Wuthering Heights
768,"your leisure hours, to be sure: why, it’s good enough to be printed!",Wuthering Heights
768,And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before,Wuthering Heights
768,"him? I hav’n’t shown it yet, but you needn’t imagine I shall keep your",Wuthering Heights
768,ridiculous secrets. For shame! and you must have led the way in writing,Wuthering Heights
768,"such absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, I’m certain.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I didn’t! I didn’t!” sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart. “I didn’t",Wuthering Heights
768,once think of loving him till—”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“_Loving_!” cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word.",Wuthering Heights
768,“_Loving_! Did anybody ever hear the like! I might just as well talk of,Wuthering Heights
768,"loving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn. Pretty loving,",Wuthering Heights
768,indeed! and both times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours,Wuthering Heights
768,in your life! Now here is the babyish trash. I’m going with it to the,Wuthering Heights
768,library; and we’ll see what your father says to such _loving_.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She sprang at her precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and",Wuthering Heights
768,then she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn,Wuthering Heights
768,them—do anything rather than show them. And being really fully as much,Wuthering Heights
768,inclined to laugh as scold—for I esteemed it all girlish vanity—I at,Wuthering Heights
768,"length relented in a measure, and asked,—“If I consent to burn them,",Wuthering Heights
768,"will you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again,",Wuthering Heights
768,"nor a book (for I perceive you have sent him books), nor locks of hair,",Wuthering Heights
768,"nor rings, nor playthings?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“We don’t send playthings,” cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her",Wuthering Heights
768,shame.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nor anything at all, then, my lady?” I said. “Unless you will, here I",Wuthering Heights
768,go.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I promise, Ellen!” she cried, catching my dress. “Oh, put them in the",Wuthering Heights
768,"fire, do, do!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,But when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was,Wuthering Heights
768,too painful to be borne. She earnestly supplicated that I would spare,Wuthering Heights
768,her one or two.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton’s sake!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an",Wuthering Heights
768,"angle, and the flame curled up the chimney.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I will have one, you cruel wretch!” she screamed, darting her hand",Wuthering Heights
768,"into the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the",Wuthering Heights
768,expense of her fingers.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Very well—and I will have some to exhibit to papa!” I answered,",Wuthering Heights
768,"shaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to",Wuthering Heights
768,"finish the immolation. It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"interred them under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a",Wuthering Heights
768,"sense of intense injury, retired to her private apartment. I descended",Wuthering Heights
768,to tell my master that the young lady’s qualm of sickness was almost,Wuthering Heights
768,"gone, but I judged it best for her to lie down a while. She wouldn’t",Wuthering Heights
768,"dine; but she reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and",Wuthering Heights
768,marvellously subdued in outward aspect. Next morning I answered the,Wuthering Heights
768,"letter by a slip of paper, inscribed, “Master Heathcliff is requested",Wuthering Heights
768,"to send no more notes to Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.”",Wuthering Heights
768,"And, thenceforth, the little boy came with vacant pockets.",Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XXII,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Summer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but",Wuthering Heights
768,"the harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still",Wuthering Heights
768,uncleared. Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among,Wuthering Heights
768,"the reapers; at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and the evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad",Wuthering Heights
768,"cold, that settled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors",Wuthering Heights
768,"throughout the whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably",Wuthering Heights
768,sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her,Wuthering Heights
768,"reading less, and taking more exercise. She had his companionship no",Wuthering Heights
768,"longer; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible,",Wuthering Heights
768,with mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or,Wuthering Heights
768,"three hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her",Wuthering Heights
768,"footsteps, and then my society was obviously less desirable than his.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November—a fresh watery",Wuthering Heights
768,"afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered",Wuthering Heights
768,"leaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds—dark grey",Wuthering Heights
768,"streamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain—I",Wuthering Heights
768,"requested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of",Wuthering Heights
768,"showers. She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my",Wuthering Heights
768,umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a,Wuthering Heights
768,formal walk which she generally affected if low-spirited—and that she,Wuthering Heights
768,"invariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing",Wuthering Heights
768,"never known from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from",Wuthering Heights
768,his increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance. She went,Wuthering Heights
768,"sadly on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind",Wuthering Heights
768,"might well have tempted her to race. And often, from the side of my",Wuthering Heights
768,"eye, I could detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her",Wuthering Heights
768,cheek. I gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts. On one side,Wuthering Heights
768,"of the road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks,",Wuthering Heights
768,"with their roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too",Wuthering Heights
768,loose for the latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly,Wuthering Heights
768,horizontal. In summer Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these,Wuthering Heights
768,"trunks, and sit in the branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and I, pleased with her agility and her light, childish heart, still",Wuthering Heights
768,considered it proper to scold every time I caught her at such an,Wuthering Heights
768,"elevation, but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending.",Wuthering Heights
768,"From dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing",Wuthering Heights
768,"nothing except singing old songs—my nursery lore—to herself, or",Wuthering Heights
768,"watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young ones to",Wuthering Heights
768,"fly: or nestling with closed lids, half thinking, half dreaming,",Wuthering Heights
768,happier than words can express.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Look, Miss!” I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one",Wuthering Heights
768,twisted tree. “Winter is not here yet. There’s a little flower up,Wuthering Heights
768,"yonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those",Wuthering Heights
768,"turf steps in July with a lilac mist. Will you clamber up, and pluck it",Wuthering Heights
768,to show to papa?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy,Wuthering Heights
768,"shelter, and replied, at length—“No, I’ll not touch it: but it looks",Wuthering Heights
768,"melancholy, does it not, Ellen?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes,” I observed, “about as starved and sackless as you: your cheeks",Wuthering Heights
768,"are bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run. You’re so low, I",Wuthering Heights
768,daresay I shall keep up with you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals",Wuthering Heights
768,"to muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus",Wuthering Heights
768,"spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever",Wuthering Heights
768,"and anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Catherine, why are you crying, love?” I asked, approaching and putting",Wuthering Heights
768,my arm over her shoulder. “You mustn’t cry because papa has a cold; be,Wuthering Heights
768,thankful it is nothing worse.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled,Wuthering Heights
768,by sobs.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, it _will_ be something worse,” she said. “And what shall I do when",Wuthering Heights
768,"papa and you leave me, and I am by myself? I can’t forget your words,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Ellen; they are always in my ear. How life will be changed, how dreary",Wuthering Heights
768,"the world will be, when papa and you are dead.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“None can tell whether you won’t die before us,” I replied. “It’s wrong",Wuthering Heights
768,to anticipate evil. We’ll hope there are years and years to come before,Wuthering Heights
768,"any of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five.",Wuthering Heights
768,"My mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last. And suppose Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton were spared till he saw sixty, that would be more years than you",Wuthering Heights
768,"have counted, Miss. And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity",Wuthering Heights
768,above twenty years beforehand?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,” she remarked, gazing up with",Wuthering Heights
768,timid hope to seek further consolation.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,” I replied. “She wasn’t",Wuthering Heights
768,"as happy as Master: she hadn’t as much to live for. All you need do, is",Wuthering Heights
768,"to wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you",Wuthering Heights
768,"cheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that,",Wuthering Heights
768,Cathy! I’ll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and,Wuthering Heights
768,"reckless, and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a",Wuthering Heights
768,person who would be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to,Wuthering Heights
768,discover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it,Wuthering Heights
768,expedient to make.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I fret about nothing on earth except papa’s illness,” answered my",Wuthering Heights
768,companion. “I care for nothing in comparison with papa. And I’ll,Wuthering Heights
768,"never—never—oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word",Wuthering Heights
768,"to vex him. I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by",Wuthering Heights
768,this: I pray every night that I may live after him; because I would,Wuthering Heights
768,rather be miserable than that he should be: that proves I love him,Wuthering Heights
768,better than myself.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Good words,” I replied. “But deeds must prove it also; and after he is",Wuthering Heights
768,"well, remember you don’t forget resolutions formed in the hour of",Wuthering Heights
768,fear.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young",Wuthering Heights
768,"lady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on",Wuthering Heights
768,"the top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed",Wuthering Heights
768,scarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the,Wuthering Heights
768,"highway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could",Wuthering Heights
768,"touch the upper, except from Cathy’s present station. In stretching to",Wuthering Heights
768,"pull them, her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed",Wuthering Heights
768,scrambling down to recover it. I bid her be cautious lest she got a,Wuthering Heights
768,"fall, and she nimbly disappeared. But the return was no such easy",Wuthering Heights
768,"matter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rosebushes",Wuthering Heights
768,and blackberry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending.,Wuthering Heights
768,"I, like a fool, didn’t recollect that, till I heard her laughing and",Wuthering Heights
768,"exclaiming—“Ellen! you’ll have to fetch the key, or else I must run",Wuthering Heights
768,round to the porter’s lodge. I can’t scale the ramparts on this side!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Stay where you are,” I answered; “I have my bundle of keys in my",Wuthering Heights
768,"pocket: perhaps I may manage to open it; if not, I’ll go.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while",Wuthering Heights
768,"I tried all the large keys in succession. I had applied the last, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"found that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she would remain",Wuthering Heights
768,"there, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an",Wuthering Heights
768,approaching sound arrested me. It was the trot of a horse; Cathy’s,Wuthering Heights
768,dance stopped also.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Who is that?” I whispered.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ellen, I wish you could open the door,” whispered back my companion,",Wuthering Heights
768,anxiously.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ho, Miss Linton!” cried a deep voice (the rider’s), “I’m glad to meet",Wuthering Heights
768,"you. Don’t be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to ask and",Wuthering Heights
768,obtain.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I sha’n’t speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,” answered Catherine. “Papa",Wuthering Heights

768,the same.”,Wuthering Heights

768,"“That is nothing to the purpose,” said Heathcliff. (He it was.) “I",Wuthering Heights
768,"don’t hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I demand",Wuthering Heights
768,your attention. Yes; you have cause to blush. Two or three months,Wuthering Heights
768,"since, were you not in the habit of writing to Linton? making love in",Wuthering Heights
768,"play, eh? You deserved, both of you, flogging for that! You especially,",Wuthering Heights
768,"the elder; and less sensitive, as it turns out. I’ve got your letters,",Wuthering Heights
768,and if you give me any pertness I’ll send them to your father. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn’t you?",Wuthering Heights
768,"Well, you dropped Linton with it into a Slough of Despond. He was in",Wuthering Heights
768,"earnest: in love, really. As true as I live, he’s dying for you;",Wuthering Heights
768,"breaking his heart at your fickleness: not figuratively, but actually.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Though Hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks, and I have",Wuthering Heights
768,"used more serious measures, and attempted to frighten him out of his",Wuthering Heights
768,"idiocy, he gets worse daily; and he’ll be under the sod before summer,",Wuthering Heights
768,unless you restore him!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?” I called from the,Wuthering Heights
768,inside. “Pray ride on! How can you deliberately get up such paltry,Wuthering Heights
768,"falsehoods? Miss Cathy, I’ll knock the lock off with a stone: you won’t",Wuthering Heights
768,believe that vile nonsense. You can feel in yourself it is impossible,Wuthering Heights
768,that a person should die for love of a stranger.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I was not aware there were eavesdroppers,” muttered the detected",Wuthering Heights
768,"villain. “Worthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don’t like your",Wuthering Heights
768,"double-dealing,” he added aloud. “How could _you_ lie so glaringly as",Wuthering Heights
768,to affirm I hated the ‘poor child’? and invent bugbear stories to,Wuthering Heights
768,terrify her from my door-stones? Catherine Linton (the very name warms,Wuthering Heights
768,"me), my bonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if I",Wuthering Heights
768,"have not spoken truth: do, there’s a darling! Just imagine your father",Wuthering Heights
768,"in my place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your",Wuthering Heights
768,"careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your",Wuthering Heights
768,"father himself entreated him; and don’t, from pure stupidity, fall into",Wuthering Heights
768,"the same error. I swear, on my salvation, he’s going to his grave, and",Wuthering Heights
768,none but you can save him!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The lock gave way and I issued out.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I swear Linton is dying,” repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“And grief and disappointment are hastening his death. Nelly, if you",Wuthering Heights
768,"won’t let her go, you can walk over yourself. But I shall not return",Wuthering Heights
768,till this time next week; and I think your master himself would,Wuthering Heights
768,scarcely object to her visiting her cousin.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Come in,” said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her to",Wuthering Heights
768,"re-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of",Wuthering Heights
768,"the speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He pushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Miss Catherine, I’ll own to you that I have little patience with",Wuthering Heights
768,Linton; and Hareton and Joseph have less. I’ll own that he’s with a,Wuthering Heights
768,"harsh set. He pines for kindness, as well as love; and a kind word from",Wuthering Heights
768,you would be his best medicine. Don’t mind Mrs. Dean’s cruel cautions;,Wuthering Heights
768,"but be generous, and contrive to see him. He dreams of you day and",Wuthering Heights
768,"night, and cannot be persuaded that you don’t hate him, since you",Wuthering Heights
768,neither write nor call.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in",Wuthering Heights
768,"holding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: for",Wuthering Heights
768,"the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and",Wuthering Heights
768,warned us to avoid delay. Our hurry prevented any comment on the,Wuthering Heights
768,"encounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; but I divined",Wuthering Heights
768,instinctively that Catherine’s heart was clouded now in double,Wuthering Heights
768,"darkness. Her features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she",Wuthering Heights
768,evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The master had retired to rest before we came in. Cathy stole to his,Wuthering Heights
768,"room to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep. She returned, and",Wuthering Heights
768,asked me to sit with her in the library. We took our tea together; and,Wuthering Heights
768,"afterwards she lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she",Wuthering Heights
768,"was weary. I got a book, and pretended to read. As soon as she supposed",Wuthering Heights
768,"me absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her silent weeping: it",Wuthering Heights
768,"appeared, at present, her favourite diversion. I suffered her to enjoy",Wuthering Heights
768,it a while; then I expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff’s assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would",Wuthering Heights
768,coincide. Alas! I hadn’t skill to counteract the effect his account had,Wuthering Heights
768,produced: it was just what he intended.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You may be right, Ellen,” she answered; “but I shall never feel at",Wuthering Heights
768,ease till I know. And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I,Wuthering Heights
768,"don’t write, and convince him that I shall not change.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,What use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity? We,Wuthering Heights
768,parted that night—hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to,Wuthering Heights
768,"Wuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress’s pony. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"couldn’t bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected",Wuthering Heights
768,"countenance, and heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the",Wuthering Heights
768,tale was founded on fact.,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XXIII,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The rainy night had ushered in a misty morning—half frost, half",Wuthering Heights
768,drizzle—and temporary brooks crossed our path—gurgling from the,Wuthering Heights
768,uplands. My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly,Wuthering Heights
768,the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things. We,Wuthering Heights
768,"entered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in his own,Wuthering Heights
768,affirmation.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring",Wuthering Heights
768,"fire; a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces",Wuthering Heights
768,"of toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth. Catherine",Wuthering Heights
768,ran to the hearth to warm herself. I asked if the master was in? My,Wuthering Heights
768,"question remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had",Wuthering Heights
768,"grown deaf, and repeated it louder.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Na—ay!” he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose. “Na—ay! yah",Wuthering Heights
768,muh goa back whear yah coom frough.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Joseph!” cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner",Wuthering Heights
768,room. “How often am I to call you? There are only a few red ashes now.,Wuthering Heights
768,Joseph! come this moment.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no",Wuthering Heights
768,ear for this appeal. The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one,Wuthering Heights
768,"gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably. We knew",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton’s tones, and entered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, I hope you’ll die in a garret, starved to death!” said the boy,",Wuthering Heights
768,mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is that you, Miss Linton?” he said, raising his head from the arm of",Wuthering Heights
768,"the great chair, in which he reclined. “No—don’t kiss me: it takes my",Wuthering Heights
768,"breath. Dear me! Papa said you would call,” continued he, after",Wuthering Heights
768,recovering a little from Catherine’s embrace; while she stood by,Wuthering Heights
768,"looking very contrite. “Will you shut the door, if you please? you left",Wuthering Heights
768,it open; and those—those _detestable_ creatures won’t bring coals to,Wuthering Heights
768,the fire. It’s so cold!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself. The invalid",Wuthering Heights
768,"complained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and looked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his temper.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, Linton,” murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed,",Wuthering Heights
768,“are you glad to see me? Can I do you any good?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why didn’t you come before?” he asked. “You should have come, instead",Wuthering Heights
768,of writing. It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters. I’d far,Wuthering Heights
768,"rather have talked to you. Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor",Wuthering Heights
768,anything else. I wonder where Zillah is! Will you” (looking at me),Wuthering Heights
768,“step into the kitchen and see?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to,Wuthering Heights
768,"run to and fro at his behest, I replied—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Nobody is out there but Joseph.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I want to drink,” he exclaimed fretfully, turning away. “Zillah is",Wuthering Heights
768,constantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it’s miserable!,Wuthering Heights
768,And I’m obliged to come down here—they resolved never to hear me,Wuthering Heights
768,upstairs.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?” I asked,",Wuthering Heights
768,perceiving Catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Attentive? He makes _them_ a little more attentive at least,” he",Wuthering Heights
768,"cried. “The wretches! Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton",Wuthering Heights
768,"laughs at me! I hate him! indeed, I hate them all: they are odious",Wuthering Heights
768,beings.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Cathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the,Wuthering Heights
768,"dresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it. He bid her add a spoonful of",Wuthering Heights
768,"wine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion,",Wuthering Heights
768,"appeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And are you glad to see me?” asked she, reiterating her former",Wuthering Heights
768,"question, and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, I am. It’s something new to hear a voice like yours!” he replied.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“But I have been vexed, because you wouldn’t come. And papa swore it",Wuthering Heights
768,"was owing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and said you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be",Wuthering Heights
768,more the master of the Grange than your father by this time. But you,Wuthering Heights
768,"don’t despise me, do you, Miss—?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,” interrupted my young lady.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“Despise you? No! Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than",Wuthering Heights
768,"anybody living. I don’t love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not",Wuthering Heights
768,come when he returns: will he stay away many days?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Not many,” answered Linton; “but he goes on to the moors frequently,",Wuthering Heights
768,since the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two,Wuthering Heights
768,with me in his absence. Do say you will. I think I should not be,Wuthering Heights
768,"peevish with you: you’d not provoke me, and you’d always be ready to",Wuthering Heights
768,"help me, wouldn’t you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes,” said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair, “if I could only",Wuthering Heights
768,"get papa’s consent, I’d spend half my time with you. Pretty Linton! I",Wuthering Heights
768,wish you were my brother.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And then you would like me as well as your father?” observed he, more",Wuthering Heights
768,cheerfully. “But papa says you would love me better than him and all,Wuthering Heights
768,"the world, if you were my wife; so I’d rather you were that.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, I should never love anybody better than papa,” she returned",Wuthering Heights
768,"gravely. “And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters",Wuthering Heights
768,"and brothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and",Wuthering Heights
768,papa would be as fond of you as he is of me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed,Wuthering Heights
768,"they did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father’s aversion to",Wuthering Heights
768,her aunt. I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue. I couldn’t,Wuthering Heights
768,"succeed till everything she knew was out. Master Heathcliff, much",Wuthering Heights
768,"irritated, asserted her relation was false.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,” she answered pertly.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“_My_ papa scorns yours!” cried Linton. “He calls him a sneaking fool.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yours is a wicked man,” retorted Catherine; “and you are very naughty",Wuthering Heights
768,to dare to repeat what he says. He must be wicked to have made Aunt,Wuthering Heights
768,Isabella leave him as she did.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She didn’t leave him,” said the boy; “you sha’n’t contradict me.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She did,” cried my young lady.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, I’ll tell _you_ something!” said Linton. “Your mother hated your",Wuthering Heights
768,father: now then.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh!” exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And she loved mine,” added he.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You little liar! I hate you now!” she panted, and her face grew red",Wuthering Heights
768,with passion.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She did! she did!” sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair,",Wuthering Heights
768,and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other,Wuthering Heights
768,"disputant, who stood behind.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hush, Master Heathcliff!” I said; “that’s your father’s tale, too, I",Wuthering Heights
768,suppose.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It isn’t: you hold your tongue!” he answered. “She did, she did,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine! she did, she did!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to",Wuthering Heights
768,fall against one arm. He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough,Wuthering Heights
768,that soon ended his triumph. It lasted so long that it frightened even,Wuthering Heights
768,"me. As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the",Wuthering Heights
768,mischief she had done: though she said nothing. I held him till the fit,Wuthering Heights
768,"exhausted itself. Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down",Wuthering Heights
768,"silently. Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat",Wuthering Heights
768,"opposite, and looked solemnly into the fire.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?” I inquired, after waiting ten",Wuthering Heights
768,minutes.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I wish _she_ felt as I do,” he replied: “spiteful, cruel thing!",Wuthering Heights
768,Hareton never touches me: he never struck me in his life. And I was,Wuthering Heights
768,better to-day: and there—” his voice died in a whimper.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“_I_ didn’t strike you!” muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent",Wuthering Heights
768,another burst of emotion.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for",Wuthering Heights
768,"a quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for",Wuthering Heights
768,whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and,Wuthering Heights
768,pathos into the inflexions of his voice.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m sorry I hurt you, Linton,” she said at length, racked beyond",Wuthering Heights
768,"endurance. “But _I_ couldn’t have been hurt by that little push, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"had no idea that you could, either: you’re not much, are you, Linton?",Wuthering Heights
768,Don’t let me go home thinking I’ve done you harm. Answer! speak to me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I can’t speak to you,” he murmured; “you’ve hurt me so that I shall",Wuthering Heights
768,lie awake all night choking with this cough. If you had it you’d know,Wuthering Heights
768,"what it was; but _you’ll_ be comfortably asleep while I’m in agony, and",Wuthering Heights
768,nobody near me. I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful,Wuthering Heights
768,"nights!” And he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,” I said, “it",Wuthering Heights
768,won’t be Miss who spoils your ease: you’d be the same had she never,Wuthering Heights
768,"come. However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you’ll get",Wuthering Heights
768,quieter when we leave you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Must I go?” asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him. “Do you want",Wuthering Heights
768,"me to go, Linton?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You can’t alter what you’ve done,” he replied pettishly, shrinking",Wuthering Heights
768,"from her, “unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a",Wuthering Heights
768,fever.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, then, I must go?” she repeated.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Let me alone, at least,” said he; “I can’t bear your talking.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome",Wuthering Heights
768,"while; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a",Wuthering Heights
768,"movement to the door, and I followed. We were recalled by a scream.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing",Wuthering Heights
768,"in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined",Wuthering Heights
768,to be as grievous and harassing as it can. I thoroughly gauged his,Wuthering Heights
768,"disposition from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to",Wuthering Heights
768,"attempt humouring him. Not so my companion: she ran back in terror,",Wuthering Heights
768,"knelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet",Wuthering Heights
768,from lack of breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I shall lift him on to the settle,” I said, “and he may roll about as",Wuthering Heights
768,"he pleases: we can’t stop to watch him. I hope you are satisfied, Miss",Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy, that _you_ are not the person to benefit him; and that his",Wuthering Heights
768,"condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you. Now, then,",Wuthering Heights
768,there he is! Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care,Wuthering Heights
768,"for his nonsense, he’ll be glad to lie still.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he",Wuthering Heights
768,"rejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a",Wuthering Heights
768,stone or a block of wood. She tried to put it more comfortably.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I can’t do with that,” he said; “it’s not high enough.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine brought another to lay above it.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“That’s _too_ high,” murmured the provoking thing.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“How must I arrange it, then?” she asked despairingly.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and",Wuthering Heights
768,converted her shoulder into a support.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, that won’t do,” I said. “You’ll be content with the cushion,",Wuthering Heights
768,Master Heathcliff. Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we,Wuthering Heights
768,cannot remain five minutes longer.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, yes, we can!” replied Cathy. “He’s good and patient now. He’s",Wuthering Heights
768,beginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will,Wuthering Heights
768,"to-night, if I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I dare",Wuthering Heights
768,"not come again. Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I mustn’t come, if",Wuthering Heights
768,I have hurt you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You must come, to cure me,” he answered. “You ought to come, because",Wuthering Heights
768,you have hurt me: you know you have extremely! I was not as ill when,Wuthering Heights
768,you entered as I am at present—was I?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“But you’ve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.—I,Wuthering Heights
768,"didn’t do it all,” said his cousin. “However, we’ll be friends now. And",Wuthering Heights
768,"you want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I told you I did,” he replied impatiently. “Sit on the settle and let",Wuthering Heights
768,"me lean on your knee. That’s as mamma used to do, whole afternoons",Wuthering Heights
768,"together. Sit quite still and don’t talk: but you may sing a song, if",Wuthering Heights
768,you can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad—one of,Wuthering Heights
768,"those you promised to teach me; or a story. I’d rather have a ballad,",Wuthering Heights
768,though: begin.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine repeated the longest she could remember. The employment,Wuthering Heights
768,"pleased both mightily. Linton would have another, and after that",Wuthering Heights
768,"another, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on",Wuthering Heights
768,"until the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court,",Wuthering Heights
768,returning for his dinner.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?” asked young",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” I answered, “nor next day neither.” She, however, gave a",Wuthering Heights
768,"different response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped",Wuthering Heights
768,and whispered in his ear.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You won’t go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!” I commenced, when we were",Wuthering Heights
768,"out of the house. “You are not dreaming of it, are you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,She smiled.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, I’ll take good care,” I continued: “I’ll have that lock mended,",Wuthering Heights
768,and you can escape by no way else.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I can get over the wall,” she said laughing. “The Grange is not a",Wuthering Heights
768,"prison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler. And besides, I’m almost",Wuthering Heights
768,seventeen: I’m a woman. And I’m certain Linton would recover quickly if,Wuthering Heights
768,"he had me to look after him. I’m older than he is, you know, and wiser:",Wuthering Heights
768,"less childish, am I not? And he’ll soon do as I direct him, with some",Wuthering Heights
768,slight coaxing. He’s a pretty little darling when he’s good. I’d make,Wuthering Heights
768,"such a pet of him, if he were mine. We should never quarrel, should we,",Wuthering Heights
768,"after we were used to each other? Don’t you like him, Ellen?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Like him!” I exclaimed. “The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that,Wuthering Heights
768,"ever struggled into its teens. Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured,",Wuthering Heights
768,"he’ll not win twenty. I doubt whether he’ll see spring, indeed. And",Wuthering Heights
768,small loss to his family whenever he drops off. And lucky it is for us,Wuthering Heights
768,"that his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious",Wuthering Heights
768,and selfish he’d be. I’m glad you have no chance of having him for a,Wuthering Heights
768,"husband, Miss Catherine.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech. To speak of his,Wuthering Heights
768,death so regardlessly wounded her feelings.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He’s younger than I,” she answered, after a protracted pause of",Wuthering Heights
768,"meditation, “and he ought to live the longest: he will—he must live as",Wuthering Heights
768,long as I do. He’s as strong now as when he first came into the north;,Wuthering Heights
768,"I’m positive of that. It’s only a cold that ails him, the same as papa",Wuthering Heights
768,"has. You say papa will get better, and why shouldn’t he?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, well,” I cried, “after all, we needn’t trouble ourselves; for",Wuthering Heights
768,"listen, Miss,—and mind, I’ll keep my word,—if you attempt going to",Wuthering Heights
768,"Wuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be",Wuthering Heights
768,revived.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It has been revived,” muttered Cathy, sulkily.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Must not be continued, then,” I said.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“We’ll see,” was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to",Wuthering Heights
768,toil in the rear.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had,Wuthering Heights
768,"been wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no",Wuthering Heights
768,explanation of our absence. As soon as I entered I hastened to change,Wuthering Heights
768,my soaked shoes and stockings; but sitting such a while at the Heights,Wuthering Heights
768,"had done the mischief. On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and",Wuthering Heights
768,during three weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties:,Wuthering Heights
768,"a calamity never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am",Wuthering Heights
768,"thankful to say, since.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and",Wuthering Heights
768,cheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low. It is,Wuthering Heights
768,"wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for",Wuthering Heights
768,complaint than I had. The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton’s room she,Wuthering Heights
768,appeared at my bedside. Her day was divided between us; no amusement,Wuthering Heights
768,"usurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play;",Wuthering Heights
768,and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched. She must have had a,Wuthering Heights
768,"warm heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me. I said",Wuthering Heights
768,"her days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"generally needed nothing after six o’clock, thus the evening was her",Wuthering Heights
768,own. Poor thing! I never considered what she did with herself after,Wuthering Heights
768,"tea. And though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I",Wuthering Heights
768,remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender,Wuthering Heights
768,"fingers, instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across",Wuthering Heights
768,"the moors, I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.",Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XXIV,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,At the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move,Wuthering Heights
768,about the house. And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the,Wuthering Heights
768,"evening I asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak. We",Wuthering Heights
768,"were in the library, the master having gone to bed: she consented,",Wuthering Heights
768,"rather unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not",Wuthering Heights
768,"suit her, I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused.",Wuthering Heights
768,"She selected one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about",Wuthering Heights
768,an hour; then came frequent questions.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ellen, are not you tired? Hadn’t you better lie down now? You’ll be",Wuthering Heights
768,"sick, keeping up so long, Ellen.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, no, dear, I’m not tired,” I returned, continually.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Perceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her",Wuthering Heights
768,"disrelish for her occupation. It changed to yawning, and stretching,",Wuthering Heights
768,and—,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ellen, I’m tired.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Give over then and talk,” I answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"That was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till",Wuthering Heights
768,"eight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep;",Wuthering Heights
768,"judging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she",Wuthering Heights
768,inflicted on her eyes. The following night she seemed more impatient,Wuthering Heights
768,still; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a,Wuthering Heights
768,"headache, and left me. I thought her conduct odd; and having remained",Wuthering Heights
768,"alone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were",Wuthering Heights
768,"better, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of upstairs",Wuthering Heights
768,"in the dark. No Catherine could I discover upstairs, and none below.",Wuthering Heights
768,The servants affirmed they had not seen her. I listened at Mr. Edgar’s,Wuthering Heights
768,"door; all was silence. I returned to her apartment, extinguished my",Wuthering Heights
768,"candle, and seated myself in the window.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"reflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk",Wuthering Heights
768,"about the garden, for refreshment. I did detect a figure creeping along",Wuthering Heights
768,the inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its,Wuthering Heights
768,"emerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms. He stood a",Wuthering Heights
768,"considerable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds;",Wuthering Heights
768,"then started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"reappeared presently, leading Miss’s pony; and there she was, just",Wuthering Heights
768,"dismounted, and walking by its side. The man took his charge stealthily",Wuthering Heights
768,across the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered by the,Wuthering Heights
768,"casement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where",Wuthering Heights
768,"I awaited her. She put the door gently to, slipped off her snowy",Wuthering Heights
768,"shoes, untied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage,",Wuthering Heights
768,"to lay aside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself. The",Wuthering Heights
768,surprise petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate,Wuthering Heights
768,"exclamation, and stood fixed.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“My dear Miss Catherine,” I began, too vividly impressed by her recent",Wuthering Heights
768,"kindness to break into a scold, “where have you been riding out at this",Wuthering Heights
768,hour? And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale? Where,Wuthering Heights
768,have you been? Speak!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“To the bottom of the park,” she stammered. “I didn’t tell a tale.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And nowhere else?” I demanded.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” was the muttered reply.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, Catherine!” I cried, sorrowfully. “You know you have been doing",Wuthering Heights
768,"wrong, or you wouldn’t be driven to uttering an untruth to me. That",Wuthering Heights
768,"does grieve me. I’d rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a",Wuthering Heights
768,deliberate lie.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my",Wuthering Heights
768,neck.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, Ellen, I’m so afraid of you being angry,” she said. “Promise not",Wuthering Heights
768,"to be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"We sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold,",Wuthering Heights
768,"whatever her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she",Wuthering Heights
768,commenced—,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ve been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I’ve never missed going a",Wuthering Heights
768,"day since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left",Wuthering Heights
768,your room. I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every,Wuthering Heights
768,"evening, and to put her back in the stable: you mustn’t scold _him_",Wuthering Heights
768,"either, mind. I was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally",Wuthering Heights
768,"stayed till half-past eight, and then galloped home. It was not to",Wuthering Heights
768,amuse myself that I went: I was often wretched all the time. Now and,Wuthering Heights
768,"then I was happy: once in a week perhaps. At first, I expected there",Wuthering Heights
768,would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton: for,Wuthering Heights
768,"I had engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but, as you",Wuthering Heights
768,"stayed upstairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble. While Michael",Wuthering Heights
768,"was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got",Wuthering Heights
768,"possession of the key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit",Wuthering Heights
768,"him, because he was sick, and couldn’t come to the Grange; and how papa",Wuthering Heights
768,would object to my going: and then I negotiated with him about the,Wuthering Heights
768,"pony. He is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get",Wuthering Heights
768,"married; so he offered, if I would lend him books out of the library,",Wuthering Heights
768,"to do what I wished: but I preferred giving him my own, and that",Wuthering Heights
768,satisfied him better.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that,Wuthering Heights
768,"is their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us",Wuthering Heights
768,"that, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was",Wuthering Heights
768,"off with his dogs—robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard",Wuthering Heights
768,afterwards—we might do what we liked. She brought me some warm wine and,Wuthering Heights
768,"gingerbread, and appeared exceedingly good-natured; and Linton sat in",Wuthering Heights
768,"the arm-chair, and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and we laughed and talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we",Wuthering Heights
768,"planned where we would go, and what we would do in summer. I needn’t",Wuthering Heights
768,"repeat that, because you would call it silly.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“One time, however, we were near quarrelling. He said the pleasantest",Wuthering Heights
768,manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening,Wuthering Heights
768,"on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming",Wuthering Heights
768,"dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead,",Wuthering Heights
768,and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. That,Wuthering Heights
768,was his most perfect idea of heaven’s happiness: mine was rocking in a,Wuthering Heights
768,"rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds",Wuthering Heights
768,"flitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but",Wuthering Heights
768,close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze;,Wuthering Heights
768,"and woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with",Wuthering Heights
768,joy. He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to,Wuthering Heights
768,sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee. I said his heaven would be,Wuthering Heights
768,only half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall,Wuthering Heights
768,"asleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to",Wuthering Heights
768,"grow very snappish. At last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the",Wuthering Heights
768,right weather came; and then we kissed each other and were friends.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its",Wuthering Heights
768,"smooth uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in,",Wuthering Heights
768,if we removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help,Wuthering Heights
768,"us, and we’d have a game at blindman’s-buff; she should try to catch",Wuthering Heights
768,"us: you used to, you know, Ellen. He wouldn’t: there was no pleasure in",Wuthering Heights
768,"it, he said; but he consented to play at ball with me. We found two in",Wuthering Heights
768,"a cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores",Wuthering Heights
768,"and shuttlecocks. One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have",Wuthering Heights
768,"the C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, his name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn’t",Wuthering Heights
768,"like it. I beat him constantly; and he got cross again, and coughed,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and returned to his chair. That night, though, he easily recovered his",Wuthering Heights
768,good humour: he was charmed with two or three pretty songs—_your_,Wuthering Heights
768,"songs, Ellen; and when I was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me",Wuthering Heights
768,to come the following evening; and I promised. Minny and I went flying,Wuthering Heights
768,"home as light as air; and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet,",Wuthering Heights
768,"darling cousin, till morning.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly",Wuthering Heights
768,"that I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was",Wuthering Heights
768,"beautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"shall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what",Wuthering Heights
768,"delights me more, my pretty Linton will. I trotted up their garden, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"was turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took",Wuthering Heights
768,"my bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance. He patted Minny’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"neck, and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me",Wuthering Heights
768,"to speak to him. I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it",Wuthering Heights
768,"would kick him. He answered in his vulgar accent, ‘It wouldn’t do mitch",Wuthering Heights
768,hurt if it did;’ and surveyed its legs with a smile. I was half,Wuthering Heights
768,"inclined to make it try; however, he moved off to open the door, and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"as he raised the latch, he looked up to the inscription above, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"said, with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation: ‘Miss",Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine! I can read yon, now.’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Wonderful,’ I exclaimed. ‘Pray let us hear you—you _are_ grown",Wuthering Heights
768,clever!’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name—‘Hareton Earnshaw.’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘And the figures?’ I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to",Wuthering Heights
768,a dead halt.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘I cannot tell them yet,’ he answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Oh, you dunce!’ I said, laughing heartily at his failure.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl",Wuthering Heights
768,"gathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in",Wuthering Heights
768,"my mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really",Wuthering Heights
768,"was, contempt. I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity",Wuthering Heights
768,"and desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"reddened—I saw that by the moonlight—dropped his hand from the latch,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity. He imagined himself to",Wuthering Heights
768,"be as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own",Wuthering Heights
768,name; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn’t think the same.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!” I interrupted. “I shall not scold, but I",Wuthering Heights
768,don’t like your conduct there. If you had remembered that Hareton was,Wuthering Heights
768,"your cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how",Wuthering Heights
768,"improper it was to behave in that way. At least, it was praiseworthy",Wuthering Heights
768,ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and,Wuthering Heights
768,probably he did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed,Wuthering Heights
768,"of his ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it",Wuthering Heights
768,and please you. To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad,Wuthering Heights
768,"breeding. Had _you_ been brought up in his circumstances, would you be",Wuthering Heights
768,less rude? He was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were;,Wuthering Heights
768,"and I’m hurt that he should be despised now, because that base",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff has treated him so unjustly.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, Ellen, you won’t cry about it, will you?” she exclaimed,",Wuthering Heights
768,"surprised at my earnestness. “But wait, and you shall hear if he conned",Wuthering Heights
768,his A B C to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the,Wuthering Heights
768,"brute. I entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to",Wuthering Heights
768,welcome me.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘I’m ill to-night, Catherine, love,’ he said; ‘and you must have all",Wuthering Heights
768,"the talk, and let me listen. Come, and sit by me. I was sure you",Wuthering Heights
768,"wouldn’t break your word, and I’ll make you promise again, before you",Wuthering Heights
768,go.’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I knew now that I mustn’t tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly",Wuthering Heights
768,"and put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way. I had",Wuthering Heights
768,brought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little,Wuthering Heights
768,"of one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open:",Wuthering Heights
768,"having gathered venom with reflection. He advanced direct to us, seized",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton by the arm, and swung him off the seat.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Get to thy own room!’ he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with",Wuthering Heights
768,passion; and his face looked swelled and furious. ‘Take her there if,Wuthering Heights
768,she comes to see thee: thou shalln’t keep me out of this. Begone wi’ ye,Wuthering Heights
768,both!’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him",Wuthering Heights
768,"into the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly",Wuthering Heights
768,"longing to knock me down. I was afraid for a moment, and I let one",Wuthering Heights
768,"volume fall; he kicked it after me, and shut us out. I heard a",Wuthering Heights

768,shrieked so shockingly that I dared not proceed. At last his cries were,Wuthering Heights
768,"choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"he fell on the ground. I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"called for Zillah, as loud as I could. She soon heard me: she was",Wuthering Heights
768,"milking the cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work,",Wuthering Heights
768,she inquired what there was to do? I hadn’t breath to explain; dragging,Wuthering Heights
768,"her in, I looked about for Linton. Earnshaw had come out to examine the",Wuthering Heights
768,"mischief he had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing",Wuthering Heights
768,upstairs. Zillah and I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top,Wuthering Heights
768,"of the steps, and said I shouldn’t go in: I must go home. I exclaimed",Wuthering Heights
768,"that he had killed Linton, and I _would_ enter. Joseph locked the door,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and declared I should do ‘no sich stuff,’ and asked me whether I were",Wuthering Heights
768,‘bahn to be as mad as him.’ I stood crying till the housekeeper,Wuthering Heights
768,"reappeared. She affirmed he would be better in a bit, but he couldn’t",Wuthering Heights

768,"assertions that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison",Wuthering Heights
768,"and hanged, he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide",Wuthering Heights
768,"his cowardly agitation. Still, I was not rid of him: when at length",Wuthering Heights
768,"they compelled me to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the",Wuthering Heights
768,"premises, he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road-side, and",Wuthering Heights
768,checked Minny and took hold of me.,Wuthering Heights

768,"“I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me. He",Wuthering Heights

768,than half out of my senses.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I didn’t bid you good-night that evening, and I didn’t go to Wuthering",Wuthering Heights
768,Heights the next: I wished to go exceedingly; but I was strangely,Wuthering Heights
768,"excited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and",Wuthering Heights
768,sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton. On the,Wuthering Heights
768,"third day I took courage: at least, I couldn’t bear longer suspense,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and stole off once more. I went at five o’clock, and walked; fancying I",Wuthering Heights
768,"might manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton’s room,",Wuthering Heights
768,"unobserved. However, the dogs gave notice of my approach. Zillah",Wuthering Heights
768,"received me, and saying ‘the lad was mending nicely,’ showed me into a",Wuthering Heights
768,"small, tidy, carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"beheld Linton laid on a little sofa, reading one of my books. But he",Wuthering Heights
768,"would neither speak to me nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen:",Wuthering Heights
768,"he has such an unhappy temper. And what quite confounded me, when he",Wuthering Heights
768,"did open his mouth, it was to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned",Wuthering Heights
768,"the uproar, and Hareton was not to blame! Unable to reply, except",Wuthering Heights
768,"passionately, I got up and walked from the room. He sent after me a",Wuthering Heights
768,faint ‘Catherine!’ He did not reckon on being answered so: but I,Wuthering Heights
768,wouldn’t turn back; and the morrow was the second day on which I stayed,Wuthering Heights
768,"at home, nearly determined to visit him no more. But it was so",Wuthering Heights
768,"miserable going to bed and getting up, and never hearing anything about",Wuthering Heights
768,"him, that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed.",Wuthering Heights
768,It _had_ appeared wrong to take the journey once; now it seemed wrong,Wuthering Heights
768,"to refrain. Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny; I said ‘Yes,’",Wuthering Heights
768,and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills. I was,Wuthering Heights
768,forced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it was no use,Wuthering Heights
768,trying to conceal my presence.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Young master is in the house,’ said Zillah, as she saw me making for",Wuthering Heights
768,"the parlour. I went in; Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the",Wuthering Heights
768,room directly. Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking,Wuthering Heights
768,"up to the fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be",Wuthering Heights
768,true—,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘As you don’t like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine,’ he answered. ‘You are so",Wuthering Heights
768,"much happier than I am, you ought to be better. Papa talks enough of my",Wuthering Heights
768,"defects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it natural I should",Wuthering Heights
768,doubt myself. I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he,Wuthering Heights
768,"calls me, frequently; and then I feel so cross and bitter, I hate",Wuthering Heights
768,"everybody! I _am_ worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit,",Wuthering Heights
768,"almost always; and, if you choose, you _may_ say good-bye: you’ll get",Wuthering Heights
768,"rid of an annoyance. Only, Catherine, do me this justice: believe that",Wuthering Heights
768,"if I might be as sweet, and as kind, and as good as you are, I would",Wuthering Heights
768,"be; as willingly, and more so, than as happy and as healthy. And",Wuthering Heights
768,believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if I,Wuthering Heights
768,"deserved your love: and though I couldn’t, and cannot help showing my",Wuthering Heights

768,"reconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not",Wuthering Heights
768,entirely for sorrow; yet I _was_ sorry Linton had that distorted,Wuthering Heights
768,"nature. He’ll never let his friends be at ease, and he’ll never be at",Wuthering Heights
768,"ease himself! I have always gone to his little parlour, since that",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were",Wuthering Heights
768,the first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now,Wuthering Heights
768,"with his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but I’ve",Wuthering Heights
768,learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the,Wuthering Heights
768,latter. Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at,Wuthering Heights
768,"all. Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him",Wuthering Heights
768,abusing poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"can’t tell how he knew of it, unless he listened. Linton had certainly",Wuthering Heights
768,"behaved provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and",Wuthering Heights
768,I interrupted Mr. Heathcliff’s lecture by entering and telling him so.,Wuthering Heights
768,"He burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that",Wuthering Heights
768,"view of the matter. Since then, I’ve told Linton he must whisper his",Wuthering Heights
768,"bitter things. Now, Ellen, you have heard all. I can’t be prevented",Wuthering Heights
768,"from going to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two",Wuthering Heights
768,"people; whereas, if you’ll only not tell papa, my going need disturb",Wuthering Heights

768,and go think it over.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I thought it over aloud, in my master’s presence; walking straight from",Wuthering Heights
768,"her room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of",Wuthering Heights
768,"her conversations with her cousin, and any mention of Hareton. Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton was alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to",Wuthering Heights
768,"me. In the morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and",Wuthering Heights
768,she learnt also that her secret visits were to end. In vain she wept,Wuthering Heights
768,"and writhed against the interdict, and implored her father to have pity",Wuthering Heights
768,on Linton: all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write,Wuthering Heights
768,and give him leave to come to the Grange when he pleased; but,Wuthering Heights
768,explaining that he must no longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering,Wuthering Heights

768,"than a year ago. Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve",Wuthering Heights
768,"months’ end, I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating",Wuthering Heights
768,"them! Yet, who knows how long you’ll be a stranger? You’re too young to",Wuthering Heights
768,"rest always contented, living by yourself; and I some way fancy no one",Wuthering Heights
768,could see Catherine Linton and not love her. You smile; but why do you,Wuthering Heights
768,look so lively and interested when I talk about her? and why have you,Wuthering Heights
768,asked me to hang her picture over your fireplace? and why—?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Stop, my good friend!” I cried. “It may be very possible that _I_",Wuthering Heights
768,should love her; but would she love me? I doubt it too much to venture,Wuthering Heights
768,my tranquillity by running into temptation: and then my home is not,Wuthering Heights
768,"here. I’m of the busy world, and to its arms I must return. Go on. Was",Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine obedient to her father’s commands?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She was,” continued the housekeeper. “Her affection for him was still",Wuthering Heights
768,the chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke,Wuthering Heights
768,in the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils,Wuthering Heights
768,"and foes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he",Wuthering Heights
768,"could bequeath to guide her. He said to me, a few days afterwards, ‘I",Wuthering Heights
768,"wish my nephew would write, Ellen, or call. Tell me, sincerely, what",Wuthering Heights
768,"you think of him: is he changed for the better, or is there a prospect",Wuthering Heights
768,"of improvement, as he grows a man?’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘He’s very delicate, sir,’ I replied; ‘and scarcely likely to reach",Wuthering Heights
768,"manhood: but this I can say, he does not resemble his father; and if",Wuthering Heights
768,"Miss Catherine had the misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond",Wuthering Heights
768,her control: unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.,Wuthering Heights
768,"However, master, you’ll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him",Wuthering Heights
768,and see whether he would suit her: it wants four years and more to his,Wuthering Heights
768,being of age.’”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Edgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton",Wuthering Heights
768,"Kirk. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"we could just distinguish the two fir-trees in the yard, and the",Wuthering Heights
768,sparely-scattered gravestones.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ve prayed often,” he half soliloquised, “for the approach of what is",Wuthering Heights
768,"coming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it. I thought the memory of",Wuthering Heights
768,the hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than,Wuthering Heights
768,"the anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or, possibly, weeks,",Wuthering Heights
768,"to be carried up, and laid in its lonely hollow! Ellen, I’ve been very",Wuthering Heights
768,happy with my little Cathy: through winter nights and summer days she,Wuthering Heights
768,was a living hope at my side. But I’ve been as happy musing by myself,Wuthering Heights
768,"among those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June",Wuthering Heights
768,"evenings, on the green mound of her mother’s grave, and",Wuthering Heights
768,wishing—yearning for the time when I might lie beneath it. What can I,Wuthering Heights
768,do for Cathy? How must I quit her? I’d not care one moment for Linton,Wuthering Heights
768,"being Heathcliff’s son; nor for his taking her from me, if he could",Wuthering Heights
768,"console her for my loss. I’d not care that Heathcliff gained his ends,",Wuthering Heights
768,and triumphed in robbing me of my last blessing! But should Linton be,Wuthering Heights
768,unworthy—only a feeble tool to his father—I cannot abandon her to him!,Wuthering Heights
768,"And, hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit, I must persevere in",Wuthering Heights
768,"making her sad while I live, and leaving her solitary when I die.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Darling! I’d rather resign her to God, and lay her in the earth before",Wuthering Heights
768,me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Resign her to God as it is, sir,” I answered, “and if we should lose",Wuthering Heights
768,"you—which may He forbid—under His providence, I’ll stand her friend and",Wuthering Heights
768,counsellor to the last. Miss Catherine is a good girl: I don’t fear,Wuthering Heights
768,that she will go wilfully wrong; and people who do their duty are,Wuthering Heights
768,always finally rewarded.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Spring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he",Wuthering Heights
768,resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter. To her,Wuthering Heights
768,"inexperienced notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"then his cheek was often flushed, and his eyes were bright; she felt",Wuthering Heights
768,"sure of his recovering. On her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit",Wuthering Heights
768,"the churchyard: it was raining, and I observed—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’ll surely not go out to-night, sir?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He answered,—“No, I’ll defer it this year a little longer.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He wrote again to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"had the invalid been presentable, I’ve no doubt his father would have",Wuthering Heights
768,"permitted him to come. As it was, being instructed, he returned an",Wuthering Heights
768,"answer, intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at the",Wuthering Heights
768,"Grange; but his uncle’s kind remembrance delighted him, and he hoped to",Wuthering Heights
768,"meet him sometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his",Wuthering Heights
768,cousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"That part of his letter was simple, and probably his own. Heathcliff",Wuthering Heights
768,"knew he could plead eloquently for Catherine’s company, then.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I do not ask,” he said, “that she may visit here; but am I never to",Wuthering Heights
768,"see her, because my father forbids me to go to her home, and you forbid",Wuthering Heights
768,"her to come to mine? Do, now and then, ride with her towards the",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heights; and let us exchange a few words, in your presence! We have",Wuthering Heights
768,done nothing to deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me:,Wuthering Heights
768,"you have no reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself. Dear uncle! send",Wuthering Heights
768,"me a kind note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please,",Wuthering Heights
768,except at Thrushcross Grange. I believe an interview would convince you,Wuthering Heights
768,that my father’s character is not mine: he affirms I am more your,Wuthering Heights
768,nephew than his son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy,Wuthering Heights
768,"of Catherine, she has excused them, and for her sake, you should also.",Wuthering Heights
768,You inquire after my health—it is better; but while I remain cut off,Wuthering Heights
768,"from all hope, and doomed to solitude, or the society of those who",Wuthering Heights
768,"never did and never will like me, how can I be cheerful and well?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his",Wuthering Heights
768,"request; because he could not accompany Catherine. He said, in summer,",Wuthering Heights
768,"perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing",Wuthering Heights
768,"at intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was",Wuthering Heights
768,able by letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have",Wuthering Heights
768,spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations:,Wuthering Heights
768,"but his father kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on",Wuthering Heights
768,"every line that my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his",Wuthering Heights
768,"peculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly",Wuthering Heights
768,"uppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being",Wuthering Heights
768,held asunder from his friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton must allow an interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely",Wuthering Heights
768,deceiving him with empty promises.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Cathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length,Wuthering Heights
768,persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk,Wuthering Heights
768,"together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors",Wuthering Heights
768,nearest the Grange: for June found him still declining. Though he had,Wuthering Heights
768,"set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady’s fortune,",Wuthering Heights
768,he had a natural desire that she might retain—or at least return in a,Wuthering Heights
768,short time to—the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only,Wuthering Heights
768,prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea,Wuthering Heights
768,"that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one,",Wuthering Heights
768,"I believe: no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff to make report of his condition among us. I, for my part,",Wuthering Heights
768,"began to fancy my forebodings were false, and that he must be actually",Wuthering Heights
768,"rallying, when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed",Wuthering Heights
768,so earnest in pursuing his object. I could not picture a father,Wuthering Heights
768,treating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards,Wuthering Heights
768,"learned Heathcliff had treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness:",Wuthering Heights
768,his efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling,Wuthering Heights

768,"Summer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his",Wuthering Heights
768,"assent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first",Wuthering Heights
768,"ride to join her cousin. It was a close, sultry day: devoid of",Wuthering Heights
768,"sunshine, but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our",Wuthering Heights
768,"place of meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.",Wuthering Heights
768,"On arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a",Wuthering Heights
768,"messenger, told us that,—“Maister Linton wer just o’ this side th’",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle,” I",Wuthering Heights
768,"observed: “he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at",Wuthering Heights
768,once.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, we’ll turn our horses’ heads round when we reach him,” answered",Wuthering Heights

768,"But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from",Wuthering Heights
768,"his own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and leave ours to graze. He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach,",Wuthering Heights
768,and did not rise till we came within a few yards. Then he walked so,Wuthering Heights
768,"feebly, and looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed,—“Why, Master",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning. How ill",Wuthering Heights
768,you do look!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the,Wuthering Heights
768,ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation,Wuthering Heights
768,"on their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were",Wuthering Heights
768,worse than usual?,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No—better—better!” he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if",Wuthering Heights
768,"he needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over",Wuthering Heights
768,her; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the,Wuthering Heights
768,languid expression they once possessed.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But you have been worse,” persisted his cousin; “worse than when I saw",Wuthering Heights
768,"you last; you are thinner, and—”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m tired,” he interrupted, hurriedly. “It is too hot for walking, let",Wuthering Heights
768,"us rest here. And, in the morning, I often feel sick—papa says I grow",Wuthering Heights
768,so fast.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“This is something like your paradise,” said she, making an effort at",Wuthering Heights
768,cheerfulness. “You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the,Wuthering Heights
768,"place and way each thought pleasantest? This is nearly yours, only",Wuthering Heights
768,there are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer,Wuthering Heights
768,"than sunshine. Next week, if you can, we’ll ride down to the Grange",Wuthering Heights
768,"Park, and try mine.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of; and he had,Wuthering Heights
768,evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation. His,Wuthering Heights
768,"lack of interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity",Wuthering Heights
768,"to contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not",Wuthering Heights
768,conceal her disappointment. An indefinite alteration had come over his,Wuthering Heights
768,whole person and manner. The pettishness that might be caressed into,Wuthering Heights
768,"fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the",Wuthering Heights
768,peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be,Wuthering Heights
768,"soothed, and more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed",Wuthering Heights
768,"invalid, repelling consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured",Wuthering Heights
768,"mirth of others as an insult. Catherine perceived, as well as I did,",Wuthering Heights
768,"that he held it rather a punishment, than a gratification, to endure",Wuthering Heights
768,"our company; and she made no scruple of proposing, presently, to",Wuthering Heights
768,"depart. That proposal, unexpectedly, roused Linton from his lethargy,",Wuthering Heights
768,and threw him into a strange state of agitation. He glanced fearfully,Wuthering Heights
768,"towards the Heights, begging she would remain another half-hour, at",Wuthering Heights
768,least.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But I think,” said Cathy, “you’d be more comfortable at home than",Wuthering Heights
768,"sitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"songs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months;",Wuthering Heights
768,"you have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights

768,"me dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me. Tell",Wuthering Heights
768,"uncle I’m in tolerable health, will you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton. I couldn’t affirm that you",Wuthering Heights

768,"you about me, don’t lead him to suppose that I’ve been extremely silent",Wuthering Heights
768,"and stupid: don’t look sad and downcast, as you _are_ doing—he’ll be",Wuthering Heights
768,angry.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I care nothing for his anger,” exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be",Wuthering Heights
768,its object.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But I do,” said her cousin, shuddering. “_Don’t_ provoke him against",Wuthering Heights
768,"me, Catherine, for he is very hard.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?” I inquired. “Has he grown",Wuthering Heights
768,"weary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by",Wuthering Heights
768,"his side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on",Wuthering Heights
768,"his breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of",Wuthering Heights
768,"exhaustion or pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for",Wuthering Heights
768,"bilberries, and sharing the produce of her researches with me: she did",Wuthering Heights
768,"not offer them to him, for she saw further notice would only weary and",Wuthering Heights
768,annoy.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?” she whispered in my ear, at last. “I",Wuthering Heights
768,"can’t tell why we should stay. He’s asleep, and papa will be wanting us",Wuthering Heights
768,back.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, we must not leave him asleep,” I answered; “wait till he wakes,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and be patient. You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to",Wuthering Heights
768,see poor Linton has soon evaporated!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Why did _he_ wish to see me?” returned Catherine. “In his crossest,Wuthering Heights
768,"humours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious",Wuthering Heights
768,mood. It’s just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform—this,Wuthering Heights
768,interview—for fear his father should scold him. But I’m hardly going to,Wuthering Heights
768,come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for,Wuthering Heights
768,"ordering Linton to undergo this penance. And, though I’m glad he’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"better in health, I’m sorry he’s so much less pleasant, and so much",Wuthering Heights
768,less affectionate to me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You think _he is_ better in health, then?” I said.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes,” she answered; “because he always made such a great deal of his",Wuthering Heights
768,"sufferings, you know. He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell",Wuthering Heights
768,"papa; but he’s better, very likely.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,” I remarked; “I should",Wuthering Heights
768,conjecture him to be far worse.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if",Wuthering Heights
768,any one had called his name.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” said Catherine; “unless in dreams. I cannot conceive how you",Wuthering Heights
768,"manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I thought I heard my father,” he gasped, glancing up to the frowning",Wuthering Heights
768,nab above us. “You are sure nobody spoke?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Quite sure,” replied his cousin. “Only Ellen and I were disputing",Wuthering Heights
768,"concerning your health. Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we",Wuthering Heights
768,"separated in winter? If you be, I’m certain one thing is not",Wuthering Heights
768,"stronger—your regard for me: speak,—are you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The tears gushed from Linton’s eyes as he answered, “Yes, yes, I am!”",Wuthering Heights
768,"And, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up",Wuthering Heights
768,and down to detect its owner.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy rose. “For to-day we must part,” she said. “And I won’t conceal",Wuthering Heights
768,that I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I’ll,Wuthering Heights
768,mention it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hush,” murmured Linton; “for God’s sake, hush! He’s coming.” And he",Wuthering Heights
768,"clung to Catherine’s arm, striving to detain her; but at that",Wuthering Heights
768,"announcement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who",Wuthering Heights
768,obeyed her like a dog.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ll be here next Thursday,” she cried, springing to the saddle.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“Good-bye. Quick, Ellen!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed",Wuthering Heights
768,was he in anticipating his father’s approach.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Before we reached home, Catherine’s displeasure softened into a",Wuthering Heights
768,"perplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague,",Wuthering Heights
768,"uneasy doubts about Linton’s actual circumstances, physical and social:",Wuthering Heights
768,"in which I partook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a",Wuthering Heights
768,second journey would make us better judges. My master requested an,Wuthering Heights
768,account of our ongoings. His nephew’s offering of thanks was duly,Wuthering Heights
768,"delivered, Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest: I also threw little",Wuthering Heights
768,"light on his inquiries, for I hardly knew what to hide and what to",Wuthering Heights
768,reveal.,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XXVII,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth",Wuthering Heights
768,rapid alteration of Edgar Linton’s state. The havoc that months had,Wuthering Heights
768,previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours. Catherine,Wuthering Heights
768,we would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to,Wuthering Heights
768,"delude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful",Wuthering Heights
768,"probability, gradually ripening into certainty. She had not the heart",Wuthering Heights
768,"to mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library,",Wuthering Heights
768,where her father stopped a short time daily—the brief period he could,Wuthering Heights
768,"bear to sit up—and his chamber, had become her whole world. She grudged",Wuthering Heights
768,"each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by",Wuthering Heights
768,"his side. Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my",Wuthering Heights
768,master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a,Wuthering Heights
768,happy change of scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that,Wuthering Heights
768,she would not now be left entirely alone after his death.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall,",Wuthering Heights
768,"that, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in",Wuthering Heights
768,mind; for Linton’s letters bore few or no indications of his defective,Wuthering Heights
768,"character. And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from",Wuthering Heights
768,correcting the error; asking myself what good there would be in,Wuthering Heights
768,disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power,Wuthering Heights
768,nor opportunity to turn to account.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of,Wuthering Heights
768,"August: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed",Wuthering Heights
768,"whoever respired it, though dying, might revive. Catherine’s face was",Wuthering Heights
768,just like the landscape—shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid,Wuthering Heights
768,"succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more",Wuthering Heights
768,transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that,Wuthering Heights
768,passing forgetfulness of its cares.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.,Wuthering Heights
768,"My young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to",Wuthering Heights
768,"stay a very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on",Wuthering Heights
768,horseback; but I dissented: I wouldn’t risk losing sight of the charge,Wuthering Heights
768,committed to me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.,Wuthering Heights
768,Master Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion:,Wuthering Heights
768,"not the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked",Wuthering Heights
768,more like fear.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is late!” he said, speaking short and with difficulty. “Is not your",Wuthering Heights
768,father very ill? I thought you wouldn’t come.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“_Why_ won’t you be candid?” cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why cannot you say at once you don’t want me? It is strange, Linton,",Wuthering Heights
768,"that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose,",Wuthering Heights
768,"apparently to distress us both, and for no reason besides!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed;",Wuthering Heights
768,but his cousin’s patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical,Wuthering Heights
768,behaviour.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“My father _is_ very ill,” she said; “and why am I called from his",Wuthering Heights
768,"bedside? Why didn’t you send to absolve me from my promise, when you",Wuthering Heights
768,wished I wouldn’t keep it? Come! I desire an explanation: playing and,Wuthering Heights
768,trifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can’t dance,Wuthering Heights
768,attendance on your affectations now!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“My affectations!” he murmured; “what are they? For heaven’s sake,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine, don’t look so angry! Despise me as much as you please; I am",Wuthering Heights
768,"a worthless, cowardly wretch: I can’t be scorned enough; but I’m too",Wuthering Heights
768,"mean for your anger. Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nonsense!” cried Catherine in a passion. “Foolish, silly boy! And",Wuthering Heights
768,"there! he trembles, as if I were really going to touch him! You needn’t",Wuthering Heights
768,"bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your",Wuthering Heights
768,service. Get off! I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from,Wuthering Heights
768,"the hearth-stone, and pretending—what do we pretend? Let go my frock!",Wuthering Heights
768,"If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should",Wuthering Heights
768,"spurn such pity. Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is. Rise,",Wuthering Heights
768,and don’t degrade yourself into an abject reptile—_don’t_!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his",Wuthering Heights
768,nerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite,Wuthering Heights
768,terror.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh!” he sobbed, “I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I’m a",Wuthering Heights
768,"traitor, too, and I dare not tell you! But leave me, and I shall be",Wuthering Heights
768,"killed! _Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said",Wuthering Heights
768,"you loved me, and if you did, it wouldn’t harm you. You’ll not go,",Wuthering Heights
768,"then? kind, sweet, good Catherine! And perhaps you _will_ consent—and",Wuthering Heights
768,he’ll let me die with you!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him.",Wuthering Heights
768,"The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she",Wuthering Heights
768,grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Consent to what?” she asked. “To stay! tell me the meaning of this,Wuthering Heights
768,"strange talk, and I will. You contradict your own words, and distract",Wuthering Heights
768,"me! Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your",Wuthering Heights
768,"heart. You wouldn’t injure me, Linton, would you? You wouldn’t let any",Wuthering Heights
768,"enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it? I’ll believe you are a coward,",Wuthering Heights
768,"for yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But my father threatened me,” gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated",Wuthering Heights
768,"fingers, “and I dread him—I dread him! I _dare_ not tell!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, well!” said Catherine, with scornful compassion, “keep your",Wuthering Heights
768,secret: _I’m_ no coward. Save yourself: I’m not afraid!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her",Wuthering Heights
768,"supporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out. I was",Wuthering Heights
768,"cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should",Wuthering Heights
768,"never suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when,",Wuthering Heights
768,"hearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff",Wuthering Heights
768,"almost close upon us, descending the Heights. He didn’t cast a glance",Wuthering Heights
768,"towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton’s",Wuthering Heights
768,sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed,Wuthering Heights
768,"to none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn’t avoid doubting,",Wuthering Heights
768,he said—,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly. How are you at",Wuthering Heights
768,"the Grange? Let us hear. The rumour goes,” he added, in a lower tone,",Wuthering Heights
768,“that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his,Wuthering Heights
768,illness?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No; my master is dying,” I replied: “it is true enough. A sad thing it",Wuthering Heights
768,"will be for us all, but a blessing for him!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“How long will he last, do you think?” he asked.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I don’t know,” I said.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Because,” he continued, looking at the two young people, who were",Wuthering Heights
768,fixed under his eye—Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir,Wuthering Heights
768,"or raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his",Wuthering Heights
768,account—“because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I’d,Wuthering Heights
768,"thank his uncle to be quick, and go before him! Hallo! has the whelp",Wuthering Heights
768,been playing that game long? I _did_ give him some lessons about,Wuthering Heights
768,snivelling. Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton generally?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Lively? no—he has shown the greatest distress,” I answered. “To see",Wuthering Heights
768,"him, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the",Wuthering Heights
768,"hills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He shall be, in a day or two,” muttered Heathcliff. “But first—get up,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton! Get up!” he shouted. “Don’t grovel on the ground there: up,",Wuthering Heights
768,this moment!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear,",Wuthering Heights
768,"caused by his father’s glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing",Wuthering Heights
768,"else to produce such humiliation. He made several efforts to obey, but",Wuthering Heights
768,"his little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back",Wuthering Heights
768,"again with a moan. Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean",Wuthering Heights
768,against a ridge of turf.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Now,” said he, with curbed ferocity, “I’m getting angry—and if you",Wuthering Heights
768,don’t command that paltry spirit of yours—_damn_ you! get up directly!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I will, father,” he panted. “Only, let me alone, or I shall faint.",Wuthering Heights
768,"I’ve done as you wished, I’m sure. Catherine will tell you that I—that",Wuthering Heights
768,"I—have been cheerful. Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Take mine,” said his father; “stand on your feet. There now—she’ll",Wuthering Heights
768,"lend you her arm: that’s right, look at _her_. You would imagine I was",Wuthering Heights
768,"the devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror. Be so kind as to",Wuthering Heights
768,"walk home with him, will you? He shudders if I touch him.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Linton dear!” whispered Catherine, “I can’t go to Wuthering Heights:",Wuthering Heights
768,papa has forbidden me. He’ll not harm you: why are you so afraid?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I can never re-enter that house,” he answered. “I’m _not_ to re-enter",Wuthering Heights
768,it without you!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Stop!” cried his father. “We’ll respect Catherine’s filial scruples.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Nelly, take him in, and I’ll follow your advice concerning the doctor,",Wuthering Heights
768,without delay.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’ll do well,” replied I. “But I must remain with my mistress: to",Wuthering Heights
768,mind your son is not my business.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You are very stiff,” said Heathcliff, “I know that: but you’ll force",Wuthering Heights
768,me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Come, then, my hero. Are you willing to return, escorted by me?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile",Wuthering Heights
768,"being; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored",Wuthering Heights
768,"her to accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no",Wuthering Heights
768,"denial. However I disapproved, I couldn’t hinder her: indeed, how could",Wuthering Heights
768,she have refused him herself? What was filling him with dread we had no,Wuthering Heights
768,"means of discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and",Wuthering Heights
768,any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy. We reached the,Wuthering Heights
768,"threshold; Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had",Wuthering Heights
768,"conducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when",Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, exclaimed—“My house is not stricken",Wuthering Heights
768,"with the plague, Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit",Wuthering Heights
768,"down, and allow me to shut the door.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He shut and locked it also. I started.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You shall have tea before you go home,” he added. “I am by myself.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are",Wuthering Heights
768,"off on a journey of pleasure; and, though I’m used to being alone, I’d",Wuthering Heights
768,"rather have some interesting company, if I can get it. Miss Linton,",Wuthering Heights
768,take your seat by _him_. I give you what I have: the present is hardly,Wuthering Heights
768,"worth accepting; but I have nothing else to offer. It is Linton, I",Wuthering Heights
768,mean. How she does stare! It’s odd what a savage feeling I have to,Wuthering Heights
768,anything that seems afraid of me! Had I been born where laws are less,Wuthering Heights
768,"strict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow",Wuthering Heights
768,"vivisection of those two, as an evening’s amusement.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, “By",Wuthering Heights
768,hell! I hate them.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I am not afraid of you!” exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the",Wuthering Heights
768,latter part of his speech. She stepped close up; her black eyes,Wuthering Heights
768,flashing with passion and resolution. “Give me that key: I will have,Wuthering Heights
768,"it!” she said. “I wouldn’t eat or drink here, if I were starving.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table. He,Wuthering Heights
768,"looked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or,",Wuthering Heights
768,"possibly, reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom",Wuthering Heights
768,"she inherited it. She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in",Wuthering Heights
768,getting it out of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to,Wuthering Heights
768,the present; he recovered it speedily.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Now, Catherine Linton,” he said, “stand off, or I shall knock you",Wuthering Heights
768,down; and that will make Mrs. Dean mad.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its",Wuthering Heights
768,"contents again. “We _will_ go!” she repeated, exerting her utmost",Wuthering Heights
768,efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails,Wuthering Heights
768,"made no impression, she applied her teeth pretty sharply. Heathcliff",Wuthering Heights
768,glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment.,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face. He opened,Wuthering Heights
768,"them suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had",Wuthering Heights
768,"well secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, pulling",Wuthering Heights
768,"her on his knee, administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps",Wuthering Heights
768,"on both sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his",Wuthering Heights
768,"threat, had she been able to fall.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. “You villain!” I,Wuthering Heights
768,"began to cry, “you villain!” A touch on the chest silenced me: I am",Wuthering Heights
768,"stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"staggered dizzily back, and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a",Wuthering Heights
768,"blood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released,",Wuthering Heights
768,"put her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not",Wuthering Heights
768,"sure whether her ears were off or on. She trembled like a reed, poor",Wuthering Heights
768,"thing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I know how to chastise children, you see,” said the scoundrel, grimly,",Wuthering Heights
768,"as he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the",Wuthering Heights
768,"floor. “Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease! I shall",Wuthering Heights
768,"be your father, to-morrow—all the father you’ll have in a few days—and",Wuthering Heights
768,you shall have plenty of that. You can bear plenty; you’re no weakling:,Wuthering Heights
768,"you shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in",Wuthering Heights
768,your eyes again!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning",Wuthering Heights
768,"cheek on my lap, weeping aloud. Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of",Wuthering Heights
768,"the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say,",Wuthering Heights
768,"that the correction had alighted on another than him. Mr. Heathcliff,",Wuthering Heights
768,"perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea",Wuthering Heights
768,"himself. The cups and saucers were laid ready. He poured it out, and",Wuthering Heights
768,handed me a cup.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Wash away your spleen,” he said. “And help your own naughty pet and",Wuthering Heights
768,"mine. It is not poisoned, though I prepared it. I’m going out to seek",Wuthering Heights
768,your horses.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere. We",Wuthering Heights
768,"tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the",Wuthering Heights
768,windows—they were too narrow for even Cathy’s little figure.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Master Linton,” I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, “you",Wuthering Heights
768,"know what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or",Wuthering Heights
768,"I’ll box your ears, as he has done your cousin’s.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, Linton, you must tell,” said Catherine. “It was for your sake I",Wuthering Heights
768,came; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Give me some tea, I’m thirsty, and then I’ll tell you,” he answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mrs. Dean, go away. I don’t like you standing over me. Now, Catherine,",Wuthering Heights
768,you are letting your tears fall into my cup. I won’t drink that. Give,Wuthering Heights
768,me another.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face. I felt disgusted",Wuthering Heights
768,"at the little wretch’s composure, since he was no longer in terror for",Wuthering Heights
768,himself. The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as,Wuthering Heights
768,ever he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been menaced,Wuthering Heights
768,with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there;,Wuthering Heights
768,"and, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Papa wants us to be married,” he continued, after sipping some of the",Wuthering Heights
768,liquid. “And he knows your papa wouldn’t let us marry now; and he’s,Wuthering Heights
768,"afraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you",Wuthering Heights
768,"shall return home next day, and take me with you.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Take you with her, pitiful changeling!” I exclaimed. “_You_ marry?",Wuthering Heights
768,"Why, the man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one. And do you",Wuthering Heights
768,"imagine that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie",Wuthering Heights
768,herself to a little perishing monkey like you? Are you cherishing the,Wuthering Heights
768,"notion that _anybody_, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you",Wuthering Heights
768,"for a husband? You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with",Wuthering Heights
768,"your dastardly puling tricks: and—don’t look so silly, now! I’ve a very",Wuthering Heights
768,"good mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and",Wuthering Heights
768,your imbecile conceit.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he",Wuthering Heights
768,"took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine",Wuthering Heights
768,rebuked me.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Stay all night? No,” she said, looking slowly round. “Ellen, I’ll burn",Wuthering Heights
768,that door down but I’ll get out.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"And she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but",Wuthering Heights
768,Linton was up in alarm for his dear self again. He clasped her in his,Wuthering Heights
768,"two feeble arms sobbing:—“Won’t you have me, and save me? not let me",Wuthering Heights
768,"come to the Grange? Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn’t go and leave,",Wuthering Heights
768,after all. You _must_ obey my father—you _must_!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I must obey my own,” she replied, “and relieve him from this cruel",Wuthering Heights
768,suspense. The whole night! What would he think? He’ll be distressed,Wuthering Heights
768,already. I’ll either break or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet!,Wuthering Heights
768,"You’re in no danger; but if you hinder me—Linton, I love papa better",Wuthering Heights
768,than you!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff’s anger restored to the boy,Wuthering Heights
768,"his coward’s eloquence. Catherine was near distraught: still, she",Wuthering Heights
768,"persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn,",Wuthering Heights
768,persuading him to subdue his selfish agony. While they were thus,Wuthering Heights
768,"occupied, our jailor re-entered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Your beasts have trotted off,” he said, “and—now Linton! snivelling",Wuthering Heights
768,"again? What has she been doing to you? Come, come—have done, and get to",Wuthering Heights
768,"bed. In a month or two, my lad, you’ll be able to pay her back her",Wuthering Heights
768,"present tyrannies with a vigorous hand. You’re pining for pure love,",Wuthering Heights
768,"are you not? nothing else in the world: and she shall have you! There,",Wuthering Heights
768,to bed! Zillah won’t be here to-night; you must undress yourself. Hush!,Wuthering Heights
768,"hold your noise! Once in your own room, I’ll not come near you: you",Wuthering Heights
768,"needn’t fear. By chance, you’ve managed tolerably. I’ll look to the",Wuthering Heights
768,rest.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and",Wuthering Heights
768,the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected,Wuthering Heights
768,the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze. The lock,Wuthering Heights
768,"was re-secured. Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"stood silent. Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to",Wuthering Heights
768,her cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation. Anybody else,Wuthering Heights
768,"would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness,",Wuthering Heights
768,but he scowled on her and muttered—“Oh! you are not afraid of me? Your,Wuthering Heights
768,courage is well disguised: you _seem_ damnably afraid!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I _am_ afraid now,” she replied, “because, if I stay, papa will be",Wuthering Heights
768,miserable: and how can I endure making him miserable—when he—when,Wuthering Heights
768,"he—Mr. Heathcliff, _let_ me go home! I promise to marry Linton: papa",Wuthering Heights
768,would like me to: and I love him. Why should you wish to force me to do,Wuthering Heights
768,what I’ll willingly do of myself?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Let him dare to force you,” I cried. “There’s law in the land, thank",Wuthering Heights
768,God! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place. I’d inform if,Wuthering Heights
768,he were my own son: and it’s felony without benefit of clergy!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Silence!” said the ruffian. “To the devil with your clamour! I don’t,Wuthering Heights
768,"want _you_ to speak. Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in",Wuthering Heights
768,thinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for,Wuthering Heights
768,satisfaction. You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your,Wuthering Heights
768,residence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing,Wuthering Heights
768,"me that such an event would follow. As to your promise to marry Linton,",Wuthering Heights
768,I’ll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place,Wuthering Heights
768,till it is fulfilled.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I’m safe!” exclaimed Catherine,",Wuthering Heights
768,"weeping bitterly. “Or marry me now. Poor papa! Ellen, he’ll think we’re",Wuthering Heights
768,lost. What shall we do?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Not he! He’ll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a",Wuthering Heights
768,"little amusement,” answered Heathcliff. “You cannot deny that you",Wuthering Heights
768,"entered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to",Wuthering Heights
768,the contrary. And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement,Wuthering Heights
768,"at your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that",Wuthering Heights
768,"man _only_ your father. Catherine, his happiest days were over when",Wuthering Heights
768,"your days began. He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world",Wuthering Heights
768,"(I did, at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as _he_ went",Wuthering Heights
768,out of it. I’d join him. I don’t love you! How should I? Weep away. As,Wuthering Heights
768,"far as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless",Wuthering Heights
768,Linton make amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears,Wuthering Heights
768,to fancy he may. His letters of advice and consolation entertained me,Wuthering Heights
768,vastly. In his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and,Wuthering Heights
768,kind to her when he got her. Careful and kind—that’s paternal. But,Wuthering Heights
768,Linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself.,Wuthering Heights
768,Linton can play the little tyrant well. He’ll undertake to torture any,Wuthering Heights
768,"number of cats, if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared. You’ll",Wuthering Heights
768,"be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his _kindness_, when you get",Wuthering Heights
768,"home again, I assure you.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“You’re right there!” I said; “explain your son’s character. Show his,Wuthering Heights
768,"resemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice",Wuthering Heights
768,before she takes the cockatrice!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I don’t much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,” he answered;",Wuthering Heights
768,"“because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along",Wuthering Heights
768,"with her, till your master dies. I can detain you both, quite",Wuthering Heights
768,"concealed, here. If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and",Wuthering Heights
768,you’ll have an opportunity of judging!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ll not retract my word,” said Catherine. “I’ll marry him within this",Wuthering Heights
768,"hour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards. Mr. Heathcliff,",Wuthering Heights
768,"you’re a cruel man, but you’re not a fiend; and you won’t, from _mere_",Wuthering Heights
768,"malice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness. If papa thought I had",Wuthering Heights
768,"left him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to",Wuthering Heights
768,"live? I’ve given over crying: but I’m going to kneel here, at your",Wuthering Heights
768,"knee; and I’ll not get up, and I’ll not take my eyes from your face",Wuthering Heights
768,"till you look back at me! No, don’t turn away! _do_ look! you’ll see",Wuthering Heights
768,nothing to provoke you. I don’t hate you. I’m not angry that you struck,Wuthering Heights
768,"me. Have you never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle? _never_?",Wuthering Heights
768,"Ah! you must look once. I’m so wretched, you can’t help being sorry and",Wuthering Heights
768,pitying me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Keep your eft’s fingers off; and move, or I’ll kick you!” cried",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, brutally repulsing her. “I’d rather be hugged by a snake.",Wuthering Heights
768,How the devil can you dream of fawning on me? I _detest_ you!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept",Wuthering Heights
768,"with aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my",Wuthering Heights
768,"mouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse. But I was rendered",Wuthering Heights
768,"dumb in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be",Wuthering Heights
768,shown into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered. It was,Wuthering Heights
768,growing dark—we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate. Our host,Wuthering Heights
768,hurried out instantly: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had not. There,Wuthering Heights
768,"was a talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,” I observed to Catherine.",Wuthering Heights
768,“I wish he would arrive! Who knows but he might take our part?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,” said",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff, overhearing me. “You should have opened a lattice and",Wuthering Heights
768,called out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn’t. She’s glad,Wuthering Heights
768,"to be obliged to stay, I’m certain.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief",Wuthering Heights
768,without control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o’clock. Then,Wuthering Heights
768,"he bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah’s chamber; and I",Wuthering Heights
768,whispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get,Wuthering Heights
768,"through the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.",Wuthering Heights
768,"The window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap",Wuthering Heights
768,was safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before. We,Wuthering Heights
768,"neither of us lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and",Wuthering Heights
768,watched anxiously for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I,Wuthering Heights
768,could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"seated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment",Wuthering Heights
768,"on my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the",Wuthering Heights
768,"misfortunes of my employers sprang. It was not the case, in reality, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"am aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I",Wuthering Heights
768,thought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"At seven o’clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen. She",Wuthering Heights
768,"ran to the door immediately, and answered, “Yes.” “Here, then,” he",Wuthering Heights
768,"said, opening it, and pulling her out. I rose to follow, but he turned",Wuthering Heights
768,the lock again. I demanded my release.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Be patient,” he replied; “I’ll send up your breakfast in a while.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily; and Catherine",Wuthering Heights
768,"asked why I was still shut up? He answered, I must try to endure it",Wuthering Heights
768,"another hour, and they went away. I endured it two or three hours; at",Wuthering Heights
768,"length, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff’s.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ve brought you something to eat,” said a voice; “oppen t’ door!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me",Wuthering Heights
768,all day.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Tak’ it,” he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Stay one minute,” I began.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nay,” cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour",Wuthering Heights
768,forth to detain him.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next",Wuthering Heights
768,"night; and another, and another. Five nights and four days I remained,",Wuthering Heights
768,"altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a",Wuthering Heights
768,"model of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"On the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step",Wuthering Heights
768,"approached—lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the",Wuthering Heights
768,"room. It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk",Wuthering Heights
768,"bonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Eh, dear! Mrs. Dean!” she exclaimed. “Well! there is a talk about you",Wuthering Heights
768,at Gimmerton. I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse,Wuthering Heights
768,"marsh, and missy with you, till master told me you’d been found, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"he’d lodged you here! What! and you must have got on an island, sure?",Wuthering Heights
768,"And how long were you in the hole? Did master save you, Mrs. Dean? But",Wuthering Heights
768,"you’re not so thin—you’ve not been so poorly, have you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Your master is a true scoundrel!” I replied. “But he shall answer for,Wuthering Heights
768,it. He needn’t have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What do you mean?” asked Zillah. “It’s not his tale: they tell that in,Wuthering Heights
768,the village—about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to,Wuthering Heights
768,"Earnshaw, when I come in—‘Eh, they’s queer things, Mr. Hareton,",Wuthering Heights
768,"happened since I went off. It’s a sad pity of that likely young lass,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and cant Nelly Dean.’ He stared. I thought he had not heard aught, so I",Wuthering Heights
768,"told him the rumour. The master listened, and he just smiled to",Wuthering Heights
768,"himself, and said, ‘If they have been in the marsh, they are out now,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Zillah. Nelly Dean is lodged, at this minute, in your room. You can",Wuthering Heights
768,"tell her to flit, when you go up; here is the key. The bog-water got",Wuthering Heights
768,"into her head, and she would have run home quite flighty, but I fixed",Wuthering Heights
768,her till she came round to her senses. You can bid her go to the Grange,Wuthering Heights
768,"at once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, that her young",Wuthering Heights
768,lady will follow in time to attend the squire’s funeral.’”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mr. Edgar is not dead?” I gasped. “Oh! Zillah, Zillah!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,” she replied; “you’re right",Wuthering Heights
768,sickly yet. He’s not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another,Wuthering Heights
768,day. I met him on the road and asked.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened",Wuthering Heights
768,"below, for the way was free. On entering the house, I looked about for",Wuthering Heights
768,some one to give information of Catherine. The place was filled with,Wuthering Heights
768,"sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand. As I",Wuthering Heights
768,"hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a",Wuthering Heights
768,"slight cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay on the settle,",Wuthering Heights
768,"sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements",Wuthering Heights
768,"with apathetic eyes. “Where is Miss Catherine?” I demanded sternly,",Wuthering Heights
768,"supposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching",Wuthering Heights
768,"him thus, alone. He sucked on like an innocent.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Is she gone?” I said.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” he replied; “she’s upstairs: she’s not to go; we won’t let her.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You won’t let her, little idiot!” I exclaimed. “Direct me to her room",Wuthering Heights
768,"immediately, or I’ll make you sing out sharply.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,” he",Wuthering Heights
768,"answered. “He says I’m not to be soft with Catherine: she’s my wife,",Wuthering Heights
768,and it’s shameful that she should wish to leave me. He says she hates,Wuthering Heights
768,"me and wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan’t have",Wuthering Heights
768,"it: and she shan’t go home! She never shall!—she may cry, and be sick",Wuthering Heights
768,as much as she pleases!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he meant to",Wuthering Heights
768,drop asleep.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Master Heathcliff,” I resumed, “have you forgotten all Catherine’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"kindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when",Wuthering Heights
768,"she brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through",Wuthering Heights
768,"wind and snow to see you? She wept to miss one evening, because you",Wuthering Heights
768,would be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times,Wuthering Heights
768,"too good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though",Wuthering Heights
768,you know he detests you both. And you join him against her. That’s fine,Wuthering Heights
768,"gratitude, is it not?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The corner of Linton’s mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his",Wuthering Heights
768,lips.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?” I continued.,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Think for yourself! As to your money, she does not even know that you",Wuthering Heights
768,"will have any. And you say she’s sick; and yet you leave her alone, up",Wuthering Heights
768,there in a strange house! _You_ who have felt what it is to be so,Wuthering Heights
768,"neglected! You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them,",Wuthering Heights
768,"too; but you won’t pity hers! I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you",Wuthering Heights
768,"see—an elderly woman, and a servant merely—and you, after pretending",Wuthering Heights
768,"such affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every",Wuthering Heights
768,"tear you have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease. Ah! you’re a",Wuthering Heights
768,"heartless, selfish boy!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I can’t stay with her,” he answered crossly. “I’ll not stay by myself.",Wuthering Heights
768,"She cries so I can’t bear it. And she won’t give over, though I say",Wuthering Heights
768,"I’ll call my father. I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle",Wuthering Heights
768,her if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the,Wuthering Heights
768,"room, moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for",Wuthering Heights
768,vexation that I couldn’t sleep.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is Mr. Heathcliff out?” I inquired, perceiving that the wretched",Wuthering Heights
768,creature had no power to sympathise with his cousin’s mental tortures.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He’s in the court,” he replied, “talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says",Wuthering Heights
768,"uncle is dying, truly, at last. I’m glad, for I shall be master of the",Wuthering Heights
768,Grange after him. Catherine always spoke of it as _her_ house. It isn’t,Wuthering Heights
768,hers! It’s mine: papa says everything she has is mine. All her nice,Wuthering Heights
768,"books are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"her pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out;",Wuthering Heights
768,"but I told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine. And",Wuthering Heights
768,"then she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I",Wuthering Heights
768,"should have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and on the other uncle, when they were young. That was yesterday—I said",Wuthering Heights
768,"_they_ were mine, too; and tried to get them from her. The spiteful",Wuthering Heights
768,"thing wouldn’t let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me. I shrieked",Wuthering Heights
768,"out—that frightens her—she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges",Wuthering Heights
768,"and divided the case, and gave me her mother’s portrait; the other she",Wuthering Heights
768,"attempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained",Wuthering Heights
768,"it. He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me;",Wuthering Heights
768,"she refused, and he—he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain,",Wuthering Heights
768,and crushed it with his foot.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And were you pleased to see her struck?” I asked: having my designs in,Wuthering Heights
768,encouraging his talk.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I winked,” he answered: “I wink to see my father strike a dog or a",Wuthering Heights
768,"horse, he does it so hard. Yet I was glad at first—she deserved",Wuthering Heights
768,"punishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to",Wuthering Heights
768,"the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her",Wuthering Heights
768,"teeth, and her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the",Wuthering Heights
768,"bits of the picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall,",Wuthering Heights
768,and she has never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can’t,Wuthering Heights
768,speak for pain. I don’t like to think so; but she’s a naughty thing for,Wuthering Heights
768,"crying continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I’m afraid of her.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And you can get the key if you choose?” I said.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, when I am upstairs,” he answered; “but I can’t walk upstairs",Wuthering Heights
768,now.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“In what apartment is it?” I asked.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh,” he cried, “I shan’t tell _you_ where it is. It is our secret.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Nobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know. There! you’ve tired",Wuthering Heights
768,"me—go away, go away!” And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut",Wuthering Heights
768,his eyes again.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring",Wuthering Heights
768,"a rescue for my young lady from the Grange. On reaching it, the",Wuthering Heights
768,"astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was",Wuthering Heights
768,"intense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two",Wuthering Heights
768,or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar’s door:,Wuthering Heights
768,"but I bespoke the announcement of it myself. How changed I found him,",Wuthering Heights
768,even in those few days! He lay an image of sadness and resignation,Wuthering Heights
768,awaiting his death. Very young he looked: though his actual age was,Wuthering Heights
768,"thirty-nine, one would have called him ten years younger, at least. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"thought of Catherine; for he murmured her name. I touched his hand, and",Wuthering Heights
768,spoke.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Catherine is coming, dear master!” I whispered; “she is alive and",Wuthering Heights
768,"well; and will be here, I hope, to-night.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up,",Wuthering Heights
768,"looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon. As",Wuthering Heights
768,"soon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at",Wuthering Heights
768,the Heights. I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite,Wuthering Heights
768,true. I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I,Wuthering Heights
768,describe all his father’s brutal conduct—my intentions being to add no,Wuthering Heights
768,"bitterness, if I could help it, to his already overflowing cup.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He divined that one of his enemy’s purposes was to secure the personal,Wuthering Heights
768,"property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why",Wuthering Heights
768,"he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because",Wuthering Heights
768,ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.,Wuthering Heights
768,"However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of",Wuthering Heights
768,"leaving Catherine’s fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put",Wuthering Heights
768,"it in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her",Wuthering Heights
768,"children, if she had any, after her. By that means, it could not fall",Wuthering Heights
768,to Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Having received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young",Wuthering Heights
768,lady of her jailor. Both parties were delayed very late. The single,Wuthering Heights
768,"servant returned first. He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he",Wuthering Heights
768,"arrived at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance;",Wuthering Heights
768,and then Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village,Wuthering Heights
768,that must be done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before,Wuthering Heights
768,morning. The four men came back unaccompanied also. They brought word,Wuthering Heights
768,that Catherine was ill: too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would,Wuthering Heights
768,not suffer them to see her. I scolded the stupid fellows well for,Wuthering Heights
768,"listening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master; resolving",Wuthering Heights
768,"to take a whole bevy up to the Heights, at daylight, and storm it",Wuthering Heights
768,"literally, unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us. Her",Wuthering Heights
768,"father _shall_ see her, I vowed, and vowed again, if that devil be",Wuthering Heights
768,killed on his own door-stones in trying to prevent it!,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble. I had gone",Wuthering Heights
768,downstairs at three o’clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing,Wuthering Heights
768,"through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front",Wuthering Heights
768,"door made me jump. “Oh! it is Green,” I said, recollecting myself—“only",Wuthering Heights
768,"Green,” and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but",Wuthering Heights
768,"the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately. I put the",Wuthering Heights
768,jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself. The harvest moon,Wuthering Heights
768,shone clear outside. It was not the attorney. My own sweet little,Wuthering Heights
768,"mistress sprang on my neck sobbing, “Ellen, Ellen! Is papa alive?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes,” I cried: “yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe",Wuthering Heights
768,with us again!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She wanted to run, breathless as she was, upstairs to Mr. Linton’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"room; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Then I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to",Wuthering Heights
768,"say, she should be happy with young Heathcliff. She stared, but soon",Wuthering Heights
768,"comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured",Wuthering Heights
768,me she would not complain.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I couldn’t abide to be present at their meeting. I stood outside the,Wuthering Heights
768,"chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed,",Wuthering Heights
768,"then. All was composed, however: Catherine’s despair was as silent as",Wuthering Heights
768,"her father’s joy. She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed",Wuthering Heights
768,on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so. Kissing her cheek, he",Wuthering Heights
768,"murmured,—“I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to",Wuthering Heights
768,"us!” and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant",Wuthering Heights
768,"gaze, till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed. None",Wuthering Heights
768,"could have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely",Wuthering Heights
768,without a struggle.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too",Wuthering Heights
768,"weighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she",Wuthering Heights
768,"sat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that",Wuthering Heights
768,"deathbed, but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose. It",Wuthering Heights
768,"was well I succeeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the",Wuthering Heights
768,"lawyer, having called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how",Wuthering Heights
768,to behave. He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of,Wuthering Heights
768,"his delay in obeying my master’s summons. Fortunately, no thought of",Wuthering Heights
768,"worldly affairs crossed the latter’s mind, to disturb him, after his",Wuthering Heights
768,daughter’s arrival.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the,Wuthering Heights
768,"place. He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit. He would have",Wuthering Heights
768,carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with",Wuthering Heights
768,"his family. There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud",Wuthering Heights
768,protestations against any infringement of its directions. The funeral,Wuthering Heights
768,"was hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered",Wuthering Heights
768,to stay at the Grange till her father’s corpse had quitted it.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the,Wuthering Heights
768,"risk of liberating her. She heard the men I sent disputing at the door,",Wuthering Heights
768,and she gathered the sense of Heathcliff’s answer. It drove her,Wuthering Heights
768,desperate. Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon,Wuthering Heights
768,"after I left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father",Wuthering Heights
768,"re-ascended. He had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without",Wuthering Heights
768,"shutting it; and when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep",Wuthering Heights
768,"with Hareton, and his petition was granted for once. Catherine stole",Wuthering Heights
768,out before break of day. She dared not try the doors lest the dogs,Wuthering Heights
768,should raise an alarm; she visited the empty chambers and examined,Wuthering Heights
768,"their windows; and, luckily, lighting on her mother’s, she got easily",Wuthering Heights
768,"out of its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the fir-tree",Wuthering Heights
768,"close by. Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape,",Wuthering Heights
768,notwithstanding his timid contrivances.,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XXIX,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the",Wuthering Heights
768,"library; now musing mournfully—one of us despairingly—on our loss, now",Wuthering Heights
768,venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would,Wuthering Heights
768,be a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during,Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton’s life: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as",Wuthering Heights
768,housekeeper. That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be,Wuthering Heights
768,"hoped for; and yet I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect",Wuthering Heights
768,"of retaining my home and my employment, and, above all, my beloved",Wuthering Heights
768,"young mistress; when a servant—one of the discarded ones, not yet",Wuthering Heights
768,"departed—rushed hastily in, and said “that devil Heathcliff” was coming",Wuthering Heights
768,through the court: should he fasten the door in his face?,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"availed himself of the master’s privilege to walk straight in, without",Wuthering Heights
768,saying a word. The sound of our informant’s voice directed him to the,Wuthering Heights
768,"library; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest,",Wuthering Heights
768,eighteen years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the,Wuthering Heights
768,"same autumn landscape lay outside. We had not yet lighted a candle, but",Wuthering Heights
768,"all the apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the",Wuthering Heights
768,"splendid head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff advanced to the hearth. Time had little altered his person,Wuthering Heights
768,either. There was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more,Wuthering Heights
768,"composed, his frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other",Wuthering Heights
768,"difference. Catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she",Wuthering Heights
768,saw him.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Stop!” he said, arresting her by the arm. “No more runnings away!",Wuthering Heights
768,Where would you go? I’m come to fetch you home; and I hope you’ll be a,Wuthering Heights
768,dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience. I,Wuthering Heights
768,was embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the,Wuthering Heights
768,"business: he’s such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you’ll",Wuthering Heights
768,see by his look that he has received his due! I brought him down one,Wuthering Heights
768,"evening, the day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"never touched him afterwards. I sent Hareton out, and we had the room",Wuthering Heights
768,"to ourselves. In two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and",Wuthering Heights
768,since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I,Wuthering Heights
768,"fancy he sees me often, though I am not near. Hareton says he wakes and",Wuthering Heights
768,"shrieks in the night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him",Wuthering Heights
768,"from me; and, whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must",Wuthering Heights
768,come: he’s your concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why not let Catherine continue here,” I pleaded, “and send Master",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton to her? As you hate them both, you’d not miss them: they _can_",Wuthering Heights
768,only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m seeking a tenant for the Grange,” he answered; “and I want my",Wuthering Heights
768,"children about me, to be sure. Besides, that lass owes me her services",Wuthering Heights
768,for her bread. I’m not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness,Wuthering Heights
768,"after Linton is gone. Make haste and get ready, now; and don’t oblige",Wuthering Heights
768,me to compel you.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I shall,” said Catherine. “Linton is all I have to love in the world,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"me to him, you _cannot_ make us hate each other. And I defy you to hurt",Wuthering Heights
768,"him when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You are a boastful champion,” replied Heathcliff; “but I don’t like",Wuthering Heights
768,you well enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"torment, as long as it lasts. It is not I who will make him hateful to",Wuthering Heights
768,you—it is his own sweet spirit. He’s as bitter as gall at your,Wuthering Heights
768,desertion and its consequences: don’t expect thanks for this noble,Wuthering Heights
768,devotion. I heard him draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he,Wuthering Heights
768,"would do if he were as strong as I: the inclination is there, and his",Wuthering Heights
768,very weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I know he has a bad nature,” said Catherine: “he’s your son. But I’m",Wuthering Heights
768,"glad I’ve a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that",Wuthering Heights
768,"reason I love him. Mr. Heathcliff, _you_ have _nobody_ to love you;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and, however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of",Wuthering Heights
768,thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery. You _are_,Wuthering Heights
768,"miserable, are you not? Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?",Wuthering Heights
768,_Nobody_ loves you—_nobody_ will cry for you when you die! I wouldn’t,Wuthering Heights
768,be you!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made,Wuthering Heights
768,"up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw",Wuthering Heights
768,pleasure from the griefs of her enemies.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,” said her father-in-law,",Wuthering Heights
768,"“if you stand there another minute. Begone, witch, and get your",Wuthering Heights
768,things!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,She scornfully withdrew. In her absence I began to beg for Zillah’s,Wuthering Heights
768,"place at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would",Wuthering Heights
768,"suffer it on no account. He bid me be silent; and then, for the first",Wuthering Heights
768,"time, allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the",Wuthering Heights
768,"pictures. Having studied Mrs. Linton’s, he said—“I shall have that",Wuthering Heights
768,"home. Not because I need it, but—” He turned abruptly to the fire, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"continued, with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a",Wuthering Heights
768,"smile—“I’ll tell you what I did yesterday! I got the sexton, who was",Wuthering Heights
768,"digging Linton’s grave, to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"opened it. I thought, once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her",Wuthering Heights
768,face again—it is hers yet!—he had hard work to stir me; but he said it,Wuthering Heights
768,"would change if the air blew on it, and so I struck one side of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"coffin loose, and covered it up: not Linton’s side, damn him! I wish",Wuthering Heights
768,he’d been soldered in lead. And I bribed the sexton to pull it away,Wuthering Heights
768,"when I’m laid there, and slide mine out too; I’ll have it made so: and",Wuthering Heights
768,then by the time Linton gets to us he’ll not know which is which!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!” I exclaimed; “were you not",Wuthering Heights
768,ashamed to disturb the dead?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I disturbed nobody, Nelly,” he replied; “and I gave some ease to",Wuthering Heights
768,myself. I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you’ll have a,Wuthering Heights
768,"better chance of keeping me underground, when I get there. Disturbed",Wuthering Heights
768,"her? No! she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen",Wuthering Heights
768,years—incessantly—remorselessly—till yesternight; and yesternight I was,Wuthering Heights
768,"tranquil. I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with",Wuthering Heights
768,my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you",Wuthering Heights
768,have dreamt of then?” I said.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!” he answered. “Do",Wuthering Heights
768,you suppose I dread any change of that sort? I expected such a,Wuthering Heights
768,"transformation on raising the lid, but I’m better pleased that it should",Wuthering Heights
768,"not commence till I share it. Besides, unless I had received a distinct",Wuthering Heights
768,"impression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would",Wuthering Heights
768,hardly have been removed. It began oddly. You know I was wild after she,Wuthering Heights
768,"died; and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her",Wuthering Heights
768,spirit! I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they,Wuthering Heights
768,"can, and do, exist among us! The day she was buried, there came a fall",Wuthering Heights
768,of snow. In the evening I went to the churchyard. It blew bleak as,Wuthering Heights
768,winter—all round was solitary. I didn’t fear that her fool of a husband,Wuthering Heights
768,would wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring,Wuthering Heights
768,"them there. Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the",Wuthering Heights
768,"sole barrier between us, I said to myself—‘I’ll have her in my arms",Wuthering Heights
768,"again! If she be cold, I’ll think it is this north wind that chills",Wuthering Heights
768,"_me_; and if she be motionless, it is sleep.’ I got a spade from the",Wuthering Heights
768,"tool-house, and began to delve with all my might—it scraped the coffin;",Wuthering Heights
768,I fell to work with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the,Wuthering Heights
768,"screws; I was on the point of attaining my object, when it seemed that",Wuthering Heights
768,"I heard a sigh from some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"bending down. ‘If I can only get this off,’ I muttered, ‘I wish they",Wuthering Heights
768,may shovel in the earth over us both!’ and I wrenched at it more,Wuthering Heights
768,"desperately still. There was another sigh, close at my ear. I appeared",Wuthering Heights
768,to feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet-laden wind. I knew,Wuthering Heights
768,"no living thing in flesh and blood was by; but, as certainly as you",Wuthering Heights
768,"perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark, though it",Wuthering Heights
768,"cannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that Cathy was there: not",Wuthering Heights
768,"under me, but on the earth. A sudden sense of relief flowed from my",Wuthering Heights
768,"heart through every limb. I relinquished my labour of agony, and turned",Wuthering Heights
768,consoled at once: unspeakably consoled. Her presence was with me: it,Wuthering Heights
768,"remained while I re-filled the grave, and led me home. You may laugh,",Wuthering Heights
768,if you will; but I was sure I should see her there. I was sure she was,Wuthering Heights
768,"with me, and I could not help talking to her. Having reached the",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door. It was fastened; and, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying",Wuthering Heights
768,"upstairs, to my room and hers. I looked round impatiently—I felt her by",Wuthering Heights
768,"me—I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_! I ought to have",Wuthering Heights
768,"sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning—from the fervour of",Wuthering Heights
768,my supplications to have but one glimpse! I had not one. She showed,Wuthering Heights
768,"herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me! And, since then,",Wuthering Heights
768,"sometimes more and sometimes less, I’ve been the sport of that",Wuthering Heights
768,intolerable torture! Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch,Wuthering Heights
768,"that, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have",Wuthering Heights
768,relaxed to the feebleness of Linton’s. When I sat in the house with,Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet her; when I walked",Wuthering Heights
768,on the moors I should meet her coming in. When I went from home I,Wuthering Heights
768,"hastened to return; she _must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was",Wuthering Heights
768,certain! And when I slept in her chamber—I was beaten out of that. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"couldn’t lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she was either",Wuthering Heights
768,"outside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room,",Wuthering Heights
768,or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a,Wuthering Heights
768,child; and I must open my lids to see. And so I opened and closed them,Wuthering Heights
768,a hundred times a night—to be always disappointed! It racked me! I’ve,Wuthering Heights
768,"often groaned aloud, till that old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that",Wuthering Heights
768,"my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me. Now, since I’ve seen",Wuthering Heights
768,"her, I’m pacified—a little. It was a strange way of killing: not by",Wuthering Heights
768,"inches, but by fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me with the",Wuthering Heights
768,spectre of a hope through eighteen years!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet",Wuthering Heights
768,"with perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire,",Wuthering Heights
768,"the brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the",Wuthering Heights
768,"grim aspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of",Wuthering Heights
768,"trouble, and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one",Wuthering Heights
768,"absorbing subject. He only half addressed me, and I maintained silence.",Wuthering Heights
768,I didn’t like to hear him talk! After a short period he resumed his,Wuthering Heights
768,"meditation on the picture, took it down and leant it against the sofa",Wuthering Heights
768,to contemplate it at better advantage; and while so occupied Catherine,Wuthering Heights
768,"entered, announcing that she was ready, when her pony should be",Wuthering Heights
768,saddled.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Send that over to-morrow,” said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her,",Wuthering Heights
768,"he added: “You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"you’ll need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take,",Wuthering Heights
768,your own feet will serve you. Come along.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Good-bye, Ellen!” whispered my dear little mistress. As she kissed me,",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she",Wuthering Heights
768,"left: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and wouldn’t let me pass. He said Mrs. Linton was “thrang,” and the",Wuthering Heights
768,"master was not in. Zillah has told me something of the way they go on,",Wuthering Heights
768,otherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living. She thinks,Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk. My",Wuthering Heights
768,young lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff told her to follow her own business, and let his",Wuthering Heights
768,"daughter-in-law look after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced,",Wuthering Heights
768,"being a narrow-minded, selfish woman. Catherine evinced a child’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"annoyance at this neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted",Wuthering Heights
768,"my informant among her enemies, as securely as if she had done her some",Wuthering Heights
768,"great wrong. I had a long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a",Wuthering Heights
768,"little before you came, one day when we foregathered on the moor; and",Wuthering Heights
768,this is what she told me.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“The first thing Mrs. Linton did,” she said, “on her arrival at the",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heights, was to run upstairs, without even wishing good-evening to me",Wuthering Heights
768,"and Joseph; she shut herself into Linton’s room, and remained till",Wuthering Heights
768,"morning. Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she",Wuthering Heights
768,"entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be",Wuthering Heights
768,sent for? her cousin was very ill.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“‘We know that!’ answered Heathcliff; ‘but his life is not worth a,Wuthering Heights
768,"farthing, and I won’t spend a farthing on him.’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘But I cannot tell how to do,’ she said; ‘and if nobody will help me,",Wuthering Heights
768,he’ll die!’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Walk out of the room,’ cried the master, ‘and let me never hear a",Wuthering Heights
768,"word more about him! None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act",Wuthering Heights
768,"the nurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him.’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Then she began to bother me, and I said I’d had enough plague with the",Wuthering Heights
768,"tiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton:",Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“How they managed together, I can’t tell. I fancy he fretted a great",Wuthering Heights
768,"deal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little",Wuthering Heights
768,rest: one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes. She sometimes,Wuthering Heights
768,"came into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would",Wuthering Heights
768,fain beg assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never,Wuthering Heights
768,"dare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that",Wuthering Heights
768,"Kenneth should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to",Wuthering Heights
768,"advise or complain, and I always refused to meddle. Once or twice,",Wuthering Heights
768,"after we had gone to bed, I’ve happened to open my door again and seen",Wuthering Heights
768,her sitting crying on the stairs’-top; and then I’ve shut myself in,Wuthering Heights
768,"quick, for fear of being moved to interfere. I did pity her then, I’m",Wuthering Heights
768,"sure: still I didn’t wish to lose my place, you know.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me",Wuthering Heights
768,"out of my wits, by saying, ‘Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is",Wuthering Heights
768,"dying—I’m sure he is, this time. Get up, instantly, and tell him.’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Having uttered this speech, she vanished again. I lay a quarter of an",Wuthering Heights
768,hour listening and trembling. Nothing stirred—the house was quiet.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She’s mistaken, I said to myself. He’s got over it. I needn’t disturb",Wuthering Heights
768,them; and I began to doze. But my sleep was marred a second time by a,Wuthering Heights
768,"sharp ringing of the bell—the only bell we have, put up on purpose for",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and",Wuthering Heights
768,inform them that he wouldn’t have that noise repeated.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I delivered Catherine’s message. He cursed to himself, and in a few",Wuthering Heights
768,"minutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"followed. Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands",Wuthering Heights
768,"folded on her knees. Her father-in-law went up, held the light to",Wuthering Heights
768,"Linton’s face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards he turned to",Wuthering Heights
768,her.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Now—Catherine,’ he said, ‘how do you feel?’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“She was dumb.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘How do you feel, Catherine?’ he repeated.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘He’s safe, and I’m free,’ she answered: ‘I should feel well—but,’ she",Wuthering Heights
768,"continued, with a bitterness she couldn’t conceal, ‘you have left me so",Wuthering Heights
768,"long to struggle against death alone, that I feel and see only death! I",Wuthering Heights
768,feel like death!’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And she looked like it, too! I gave her a little wine. Hareton and",Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"heard our talk from outside, now entered. Joseph was fain, I believe,",Wuthering Heights
768,of the lad’s removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was,Wuthering Heights
768,more taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton. But,Wuthering Heights
768,the master bid him get off to bed again: we didn’t want his help. He,Wuthering Heights
768,"afterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to",Wuthering Heights
768,"return to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to",Wuthering Heights
768,"breakfast: she had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she",Wuthering Heights
768,"was ill; at which I hardly wondered. I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he",Wuthering Heights
768,"replied,—‘Well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and",Wuthering Heights
768,"then to get her what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell",Wuthering Heights
768,me.’”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her",Wuthering Heights
768,"twice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts",Wuthering Heights
768,at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff went up once, to show her Linton’s will. He had bequeathed",Wuthering Heights
768,"the whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his",Wuthering Heights
768,"father: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act",Wuthering Heights
768,"during her week’s absence, when his uncle died. The lands, being a",Wuthering Heights
768,"minor, he could not meddle with. However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed",Wuthering Heights
768,and kept them in his wife’s right and his also: I suppose legally; at,Wuthering Heights
768,"any rate, Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his",Wuthering Heights
768,possession.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nobody,” said Zillah, “ever approached her door, except that once, but",Wuthering Heights
768,I; and nobody asked anything about her. The first occasion of her,Wuthering Heights
768,coming down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon. She had cried,Wuthering Heights
768,"out, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn’t bear any longer",Wuthering Heights
768,being in the cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross,Wuthering Heights
768,"Grange, and Earnshaw and I needn’t hinder her from descending; so, as",Wuthering Heights
768,"soon as she heard Heathcliff’s horse trot off, she made her appearance,",Wuthering Heights
768,"donned in black, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as",Wuthering Heights
768,plain as a Quaker: she couldn’t comb them out.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays:” the kirk, (you know,",Wuthering Heights
768,"has no minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists’",Wuthering Heights
768,"or Baptists’ place, I can’t say which it is, at Gimmerton, a chapel.)",Wuthering Heights
768,"“Joseph had gone,” she continued, “but I thought proper to bide at",Wuthering Heights
768,home. Young folks are always the better for an elder’s over-looking;,Wuthering Heights
768,"and Hareton, with all his bashfulness, isn’t a model of nice behaviour.",Wuthering Heights
768,"I let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she",Wuthering Heights
768,had been always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good,Wuthering Heights
768,"leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"coloured up at the news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes.",Wuthering Heights
768,The train-oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute. I saw,Wuthering Heights
768,"he meant to give her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted",Wuthering Heights
768,"to be presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master",Wuthering Heights
768,"is by, I offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion.",Wuthering Heights
768,"He grew sullen, and began to swear.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Now, Mrs. Dean,” Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner,",Wuthering Heights
768,“you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen,Wuthering Heights
768,you’re right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg,Wuthering Heights
768,"lower. And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her,",Wuthering Heights
768,"now? She’s as poor as you or I: poorer, I’ll be bound: you’re saving,",Wuthering Heights
768,and I’m doing my little all that road.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Hareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into,Wuthering Heights
768,"a good humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former",Wuthering Heights
768,"insults, he tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper’s",Wuthering Heights
768,account.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Missis walked in,” she said, “as chill as an icicle, and as high as a",Wuthering Heights
768,"princess. I got up and offered her my seat in the arm-chair. No, she",Wuthering Heights
768,"turned up her nose at my civility. Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come",Wuthering Heights
768,"to the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘I’ve been starved a month and more,’ she answered, resting on the",Wuthering Heights
768,word as scornful as she could.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both",Wuthering Heights
768,"of us. Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and",Wuthering Heights
768,discovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her,Wuthering Heights
768,"feet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up. Her",Wuthering Heights
768,"cousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage",Wuthering Heights
768,"to help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that",Wuthering Heights
768,came to hand.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“That was a great advance for the lad. She didn’t thank him; still, he",Wuthering Heights
768,"felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to",Wuthering Heights
768,"stand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what",Wuthering Heights
768,struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was,Wuthering Heights
768,he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his,Wuthering Heights
768,finger: he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking,Wuthering Heights
768,"at her instead of the book. She continued reading, or seeking for",Wuthering Heights
768,"something to read. His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in",Wuthering Heights
768,"the study of her thick silky curls: her face he couldn’t see, and she",Wuthering Heights
768,"couldn’t see him. And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but",Wuthering Heights
768,"attracted like a child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring",Wuthering Heights
768,"to touching; he put out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if",Wuthering Heights
768,"it were a bird. He might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started",Wuthering Heights
768,round in such a taking.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“‘Get away this moment! How dare you touch me? Why are you stopping,Wuthering Heights
768,"there?’ she cried, in a tone of disgust. ‘I can’t endure you! I’ll go",Wuthering Heights
768,"upstairs again, if you come near me.’",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do: he sat down",Wuthering Heights
768,"in the settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her volumes",Wuthering Heights
768,"another half hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered to me.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah? I’m stalled of doing naught;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and I do like—I could like to hear her! Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask",Wuthering Heights
768,of yourseln.’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma’am,’ I said, immediately.",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She frowned; and looking up, answered—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough to",Wuthering Heights
768,understand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the,Wuthering Heights
768,"hypocrisy to offer! I despise you, and will have nothing to say to any",Wuthering Heights
768,"of you! When I would have given my life for one kind word, even to see",Wuthering Heights
768,"one of your faces, you all kept off. But I won’t complain to you! I’m",Wuthering Heights
768,driven down here by the cold; not either to amuse you or enjoy your,Wuthering Heights
768,society.’,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“‘What could I ha’ done?’ began Earnshaw. ‘How was I to blame?’,Wuthering Heights

768,such a concern as you.’,Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“‘Be silent! I’ll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your",Wuthering Heights

768,"“Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him! and unslinging his",Wuthering Heights
768,"gun, restrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"talked now, freely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her",Wuthering Heights
768,"solitude: but the frost had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was",Wuthering Heights
768,"forced to condescend to our company, more and more. However, I took",Wuthering Heights
768,"care there should be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since,",Wuthering Heights
768,I’ve been as stiff as herself; and she has no lover or liker among us:,Wuthering Heights
768,"and she does not deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her,",Wuthering Heights
768,and she’ll curl back without respect of any one. She’ll snap at the,Wuthering Heights

768,"hurt she gets, the more venomous she grows.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"At first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my",Wuthering Heights
768,"situation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and live with me:",Wuthering Heights
768,but Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up Hareton,Wuthering Heights

768,"Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty. I went to the Heights as I",Wuthering Heights
768,proposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to,Wuthering Heights
768,"her young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not",Wuthering Heights
768,"conscious of anything odd in her request. The front door stood open,",Wuthering Heights
768,"but the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and",Wuthering Heights
768,"invoked Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,entered. The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen. I took,Wuthering Heights
768,particular notice of him this time; but then he does his best,Wuthering Heights
768,apparently to make the least of his advantages.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home? He answered, No; but he would",Wuthering Heights
768,"be in at dinner-time. It was eleven o’clock, and I announced my",Wuthering Heights
768,intention of going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately,Wuthering Heights
768,"flung down his tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not",Wuthering Heights
768,as a substitute for the host.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in",Wuthering Heights
768,preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more,Wuthering Heights
768,sulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first. She hardly,Wuthering Heights
768,"raised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the",Wuthering Heights
768,same disregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning,Wuthering Heights
768,my bow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“She does not seem so amiable,” I thought, “as Mrs. Dean would persuade",Wuthering Heights
768,"me to believe. She’s a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen. “Remove them,Wuthering Heights
768,"yourself,” she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and",Wuthering Heights
768,"retiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of",Wuthering Heights
768,birds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap. I approached,Wuthering Heights
768,"her, pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied,",Wuthering Heights
768,"adroitly dropped Mrs. Dean’s note on to her knee, unnoticed by",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton—but she asked aloud, “What is that?” And chucked it off.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,” I",Wuthering Heights
768,"answered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it",Wuthering Heights
768,should be imagined a missive of my own. She would gladly have gathered,Wuthering Heights
768,"it up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it",Wuthering Heights
768,"in his waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Thereat, Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very",Wuthering Heights
768,"stealthily, drew out her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her",Wuthering Heights
768,"eyes; and her cousin, after struggling awhile to keep down his softer",Wuthering Heights
768,"feelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her,",Wuthering Heights
768,as ungraciously as he could. Catherine caught and perused it eagerly;,Wuthering Heights
768,"then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates, rational and",Wuthering Heights
768,"irrational, of her former home; and gazing towards the hills, murmured",Wuthering Heights

768,“I should like to be riding Minny down there! I should like to be,Wuthering Heights

768,The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at,Wuthering Heights

768,"similar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean’s anecdote of his first",Wuthering Heights
768,"attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"observed,—“But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and",Wuthering Heights

768,"instead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.”",Wuthering Heights

768,"with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations! Those books, both prose",Wuthering Heights
768,"and verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to",Wuthering Heights
768,"have them debased and profaned in his mouth! Besides, of all, he has",Wuthering Heights
768,"selected my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out",Wuthering Heights
768,of deliberate malice.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Hareton’s chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe,Wuthering Heights
768,"sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to",Wuthering Heights
768,"suppress. I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his",Wuthering Heights
768,"embarrassment, took up my station in the doorway, surveying the",Wuthering Heights
768,"external prospect as I stood. He followed my example, and left the",Wuthering Heights
768,"room; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his",Wuthering Heights
768,"hands, which he threw into Catherine’s lap, exclaiming,—“Take them! I",Wuthering Heights
768,"never want to hear, or read, or think of them again!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I won’t have them now,” she answered. “I shall connect them with you,",Wuthering Heights

768,"She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a",Wuthering Heights
768,"portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it",Wuthering Heights
768,"from her. “And listen,” she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse",Wuthering Heights
768,of an old ballad in the same fashion.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not",Wuthering Heights
768,"altogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue.",Wuthering Heights
768,The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin’s sensitive,Wuthering Heights
768,"though uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode",Wuthering Heights
768,"he had of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the",Wuthering Heights
768,inflictor. He afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the,Wuthering Heights
768,fire. I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that,Wuthering Heights
768,"sacrifice to spleen. I fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the",Wuthering Heights
768,"pleasure they had already imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing",Wuthering Heights
768,pleasure he had anticipated from them; and I fancied I guessed the,Wuthering Heights
768,incitement to his secret studies also. He had been content with daily,Wuthering Heights
768,"labour and rough animal enjoyments, till Catherine crossed his path.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Shame at her scorn, and hope of her approval, were his first prompters",Wuthering Heights
768,to higher pursuits; and instead of guarding him from one and winning,Wuthering Heights
768,"him to the other, his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the",Wuthering Heights
768,contrary result.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, that’s all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!”",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’d _better_ hold your tongue, now,” he answered fiercely.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,And his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the,Wuthering Heights
768,"entrance, where I made way for him to pass. But ere he had crossed the",Wuthering Heights
768,"door-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and laying hold of his shoulder asked,—“What’s to do now, my lad?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Naught, naught,” he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger",Wuthering Heights
768,in solitude.,Wuthering Heights

768,"Heathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights

768,see him.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in. There was a",Wuthering Heights
768,"restless, anxious expression in his countenance, I had never remarked",Wuthering Heights
768,"there before; and he looked sparer in person. His daughter-in-law, on",Wuthering Heights
768,"perceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen,",Wuthering Heights
768,so that I remained alone.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,” he said, in",Wuthering Heights
768,reply to my greeting; “from selfish motives partly: I don’t think I,Wuthering Heights
768,could readily supply your loss in this desolation. I’ve wondered more,Wuthering Heights
768,than once what brought you here.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“An idle whim, I fear, sir,” was my answer; “or else an idle whim is",Wuthering Heights
768,going to spirit me away. I shall set out for London next week; and I,Wuthering Heights
768,must give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross,Wuthering Heights

768,not live there any more.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh, indeed; you’re tired of being banished from the world, are you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,he said. “But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you,Wuthering Heights
768,"won’t occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my",Wuthering Heights
768,due from any one.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m coming to plead off nothing about it,” I exclaimed, considerably",Wuthering Heights

768,my note-book from my pocket.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, no,” he replied, coolly; “you’ll leave sufficient behind to cover",Wuthering Heights
768,"your debts, if you fail to return: I’m not in such a hurry. Sit down",Wuthering Heights
768,and take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XXXII,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,1802.—This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend,Wuthering Heights
768,"in the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came",Wuthering Heights
768,within fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The ostler at a roadside,Wuthering Heights
768,"public-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a",Wuthering Heights
768,"cart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he",Wuthering Heights
768,"remarked,—“Yon’s frough Gimmerton, nah! They’re allas three wick’ after",Wuthering Heights
768,other folk wi’ ther harvest.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Gimmerton?” I repeated—my residence in that locality had already grown,Wuthering Heights
768,dim and dreamy. “Ah! I know. How far is it from this?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Happen fourteen mile o’er th’ hills; and a rough road,” he answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was scarcely,Wuthering Heights
768,"noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own",Wuthering Heights
768,"roof as in an inn. Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange",Wuthering Heights
768,"matters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading",Wuthering Heights
768,"the neighbourhood again. Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to",Wuthering Heights
768,"inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts,",Wuthering Heights
768,we managed the distance in some three hours.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone. The grey church",Wuthering Heights
768,"looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier. I distinguished a",Wuthering Heights
768,"moor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves. It was sweet, warm",Wuthering Heights
768,weather—too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from,Wuthering Heights
768,enjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer,Wuthering Heights
768,"August, I’m sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its",Wuthering Heights
768,"solitudes. In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more",Wuthering Heights
768,"divine, than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells",Wuthering Heights
768,of heath.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the",Wuthering Heights
768,"family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin,",Wuthering Heights
768,"blue wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"rode into the court. Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat",Wuthering Heights
768,"knitting, and an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a",Wuthering Heights
768,meditative pipe.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Is Mrs. Dean within?” I demanded of the dame.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mistress Dean? Nay!” she answered, “she doesn’t bide here: shoo’s up",Wuthering Heights
768,at th’ Heights.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Are you the housekeeper, then?” I continued.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Eea, Aw keep th’ hause,” she replied.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, I’m Mr. Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms to lodge me",Wuthering Heights
768,"in, I wonder? I wish to stay all night.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“T’ maister!” she cried in astonishment. “Whet, whoiver knew yah wur",Wuthering Heights
768,coming? Yah sud ha’ send word. They’s nowt norther dry nor mensful,Wuthering Heights
768,abaht t’ place: nowt there isn’t!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"entered too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover,",Wuthering Heights
768,"that I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her",Wuthering Heights
768,"be composed. I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to",Wuthering Heights
768,"prepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to",Wuthering Heights
768,"sleep in. No sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were",Wuthering Heights
768,necessary. She seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the,Wuthering Heights
768,"hearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"malappropriated several other articles of her craft: but I retired,",Wuthering Heights
768,confiding in her energy for a resting-place against my return.,Wuthering Heights
768,Wuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion. An,Wuthering Heights
768,"after-thought brought me back, when I had quitted the court.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“All well at the Heights?” I inquired of the woman.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Eea, f’r owt ee knaw!” she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot",Wuthering Heights
768,cinders.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was",Wuthering Heights
768,"impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my",Wuthering Heights
768,"exit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and the mild glory of a rising moon in front—one fading, and the other",Wuthering Heights
768,"brightening—as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road",Wuthering Heights
768,branching off to Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling. Before I arrived in sight,Wuthering Heights
768,"of it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the",Wuthering Heights
768,"west: but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of",Wuthering Heights
768,"grass, by that splendid moon. I had neither to climb the gate nor to",Wuthering Heights
768,"knock—it yielded to my hand. That is an improvement, I thought. And I",Wuthering Heights
768,"noticed another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and",Wuthering Heights
768,wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a",Wuthering Heights
768,"coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which",Wuthering Heights
768,the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. But the house,Wuthering Heights
768,of Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space,Wuthering Heights
768,for withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates,Wuthering Heights
768,there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"could both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and",Wuthering Heights
768,listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of,Wuthering Heights
768,"curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Con-_trary_!” said a voice as sweet as a silver bell. “That for the,Wuthering Heights
768,"third time, you dunce! I’m not going to tell you again. Recollect, or",Wuthering Heights
768,I’ll pull your hair!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Contrary, then,” answered another, in deep but softened tones. “And",Wuthering Heights
768,"now, kiss me, for minding so well.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed",Wuthering Heights
768,"and seated at a table, having a book before him. His handsome features",Wuthering Heights
768,"glowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the",Wuthering Heights
768,"page to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a",Wuthering Heights
768,"smart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of",Wuthering Heights
768,"inattention. Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets",Wuthering Heights
768,"blending, at intervals, with his brown locks, as she bent to",Wuthering Heights
768,superintend his studies; and her face—it was lucky he could not see her,Wuthering Heights
768,"face, or he would never have been so steady. I could; and I bit my lip",Wuthering Heights
768,"in spite, at having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing",Wuthering Heights
768,something besides staring at its smiting beauty.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil",Wuthering Heights
768,"claimed a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he",Wuthering Heights
768,"generously returned. Then they came to the door, and from their",Wuthering Heights
768,conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on,Wuthering Heights
768,the moors. I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw’s,Wuthering Heights
768,"heart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions",Wuthering Heights
768,if I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and,Wuthering Heights
768,"feeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the",Wuthering Heights
768,kitchen. There was unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at,Wuthering Heights
768,"the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which",Wuthering Heights
768,was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and,Wuthering Heights
768,"intolerance, uttered in far from musical accents.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’d rayther, by th’ haulf, hev’ ’em swearing i’ my lugs fro’h morn to",Wuthering Heights
768,"neeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!” said the tenant of the kitchen, in",Wuthering Heights
768,"answer to an unheard speech of Nelly’s. “It’s a blazing shame, that I",Wuthering Heights
768,"cannot oppen t’ blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan,",Wuthering Heights
768,and all t’ flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th’ warld!,Wuthering Heights
768,Oh! ye’re a raight nowt; and shoo’s another; and that poor lad ’ll be,Wuthering Heights
768,"lost atween ye. Poor lad!” he added, with a groan; “he’s witched: I’m",Wuthering Heights
768,"sartin on’t. Oh, Lord, judge ’em, for there’s norther law nor justice",Wuthering Heights
768,among wer rullers!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,” retorted",Wuthering Heights
768,"the singer. “But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian,",Wuthering Heights
768,and never mind me. This is ‘Fairy Annie’s Wedding’—a bonny tune—it goes,Wuthering Heights
768,to a dance.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me",Wuthering Heights
768,"directly, she jumped to her feet, crying—“Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!",Wuthering Heights
768,How could you think of returning in this way? All’s shut up at,Wuthering Heights
768,Thrushcross Grange. You should have given us notice!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ve arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,”",Wuthering Heights
768,I answered. “I depart again to-morrow. And how are you transplanted,Wuthering Heights
768,"here, Mrs. Dean? tell me that.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went",Wuthering Heights
768,"to London, and stay till you returned. But, step in, pray! Have you",Wuthering Heights
768,walked from Gimmerton this evening?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“From the Grange,” I replied; “and while they make me lodging room",Wuthering Heights
768,"there, I want to finish my business with your master; because I don’t",Wuthering Heights
768,think of having another opportunity in a hurry.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What business, sir?” said Nelly, conducting me into the house. “He’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"gone out at present, and won’t return soon.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“About the rent,” I answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,” she observed;",Wuthering Heights
768,"“or rather with me. She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I",Wuthering Heights
768,act for her: there’s nobody else.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I looked surprised.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff’s death, I see,” she continued.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Heathcliff dead!” I exclaimed, astonished. “How long ago?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I’ll",Wuthering Heights
768,"tell you all about it. Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home. You sit down too. I,Wuthering Heights
768,never dreamt of his dying! Let me hear how it came to pass. You say you,Wuthering Heights
768,don’t expect them back for some time—the young people?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“No—I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they,Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph",Wuthering Heights

768,"She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a",Wuthering Heights
768,"reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.",Wuthering Heights
768,And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff’s,Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving",Wuthering Heights
768,"us, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine’s sake. My first",Wuthering Heights
768,interview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much,Wuthering Heights
768,since our separation. Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for,Wuthering Heights
768,"taking a new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me,",Wuthering Heights
768,and he was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my,Wuthering Heights
768,"sitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to",Wuthering Heights
768,see her once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at this arrangement;,Wuthering Heights
768,"and, by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other",Wuthering Heights
768,"articles, that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered",Wuthering Heights
768,myself we should get on in tolerable comfort. The delusion did not last,Wuthering Heights
768,"long. Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable",Wuthering Heights
768,"and restless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the",Wuthering Heights
768,"garden, and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as",Wuthering Heights
768,"spring drew on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to",Wuthering Heights
768,"quit her frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred",Wuthering Heights
768,quarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her,Wuthering Heights
768,solitude. I did not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often,Wuthering Heights
768,"obliged to seek the kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the",Wuthering Heights
768,house to himself; and though in the beginning she either left it at his,Wuthering Heights
768,"approach, or quietly joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or",Wuthering Heights
768,addressing him—and though he was always as sullen and silent as,Wuthering Heights
768,"possible—after a while, she changed her behaviour, and became incapable",Wuthering Heights
768,of letting him alone: talking at him; commenting on his stupidity and,Wuthering Heights
768,idleness; expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he,Wuthering Heights
768,"lived—how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire, and",Wuthering Heights
768,dozing.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He’s just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?” she once observed, “or a",Wuthering Heights
768,"cart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What",Wuthering Heights
768,"a blank, dreary mind he must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? And, if",Wuthering Heights
768,"you do, what is it about? But you can’t speak to me!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Then she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look,Wuthering Heights
768,again.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He’s, perhaps, dreaming now,” she continued. “He twitched his shoulder",Wuthering Heights
768,"as Juno twitches hers. Ask him, Ellen.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs, if you don’t",Wuthering Heights
768,behave!” I said. He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his,Wuthering Heights
768,"fist, as if tempted to use it.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,” she",Wuthering Heights
768,"exclaimed, on another occasion. “He is afraid I shall laugh at him.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Ellen, what do you think? He began to teach himself to read once; and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"because I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a",Wuthering Heights
768,fool?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Were not you naughty?” I said; “answer me that.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Perhaps I was,” she went on; “but I did not expect him to be so silly.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now? I’ll try!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, I shall put it here,” she said, “in the table-drawer; and I’m",Wuthering Heights
768,going to bed.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed. But",Wuthering Heights
768,"he would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her",Wuthering Heights
768,great disappointment. I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness,Wuthering Heights
768,and indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off,Wuthering Heights
768,improving himself: she had done it effectually. But her ingenuity was,Wuthering Heights
768,"at work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such",Wuthering Heights
768,"stationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would",Wuthering Heights
768,bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me. When Hareton was,Wuthering Heights
768,"there, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book",Wuthering Heights
768,lying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a,Wuthering Heights
768,"mule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to",Wuthering Heights
768,"smoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of",Wuthering Heights
768,"the fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense,",Wuthering Heights
768,"as he would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to",Wuthering Heights
768,disregard it. On fine evenings the latter followed his shooting,Wuthering Heights
768,"expeditions, and Catherine yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to",Wuthering Heights
768,"her, and ran off into the court or garden the moment I began; and, as a",Wuthering Heights
768,"last resource, cried, and said she was tired of living: her life was",Wuthering Heights
768,useless.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had",Wuthering Heights
768,almost banished Earnshaw from his apartment. Owing to an accident at,Wuthering Heights
768,"the commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the",Wuthering Heights
768,kitchen. His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter,Wuthering Heights
768,"cut his arm, and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach",Wuthering Heights
768,"home. The consequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the",Wuthering Heights
768,"fireside and tranquillity, till he made it up again. It suited",Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine to have him there: at any rate, it made her hate her room",Wuthering Heights
768,upstairs more than ever: and she would compel me to find out business,Wuthering Heights
768,"below, that she might accompany me.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"in the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen. Earnshaw",Wuthering Heights
768,"sat, morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was",Wuthering Heights
768,"beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes,",Wuthering Heights
768,"varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered",Wuthering Heights
768,"ejaculations, and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the",Wuthering Heights
768,"direction of her cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the",Wuthering Heights
768,grate. At a notice that I could do with her no longer intercepting my,Wuthering Heights
768,"light, she removed to the hearthstone. I bestowed little attention on",Wuthering Heights
768,"her proceedings, but, presently, I heard her begin—“I’ve found out,",Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton, that I want—that I’m glad—that I should like you to be my",Wuthering Heights
768,"cousin now, if you had not grown so cross to me, and so rough.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Hareton returned no answer.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?” she continued.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Get off wi’ ye!” he growled, with uncompromising gruffness.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Let me take that pipe,” she said, cautiously advancing her hand and",Wuthering Heights
768,abstracting it from his mouth.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the",Wuthering Heights
768,fire. He swore at her and seized another.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Stop,” she cried, “you must listen to me first; and I can’t speak",Wuthering Heights
768,while those clouds are floating in my face.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Will you go to the devil!” he exclaimed, ferociously, “and let me be!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No,” she persisted, “I won’t: I can’t tell what to do to make you talk",Wuthering Heights
768,to me; and you are determined not to understand. When I call you,Wuthering Heights
768,"stupid, I don’t mean anything: I don’t mean that I despise you. Come,",Wuthering Heights
768,"you shall take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall",Wuthering Heights
768,own me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I shall have naught to do wi’ you and your mucky pride, and your",Wuthering Heights
768,"damned mocking tricks!” he answered. “I’ll go to hell, body and soul,",Wuthering Heights
768,"before I look sideways after you again. Side out o’ t’ gate, now, this",Wuthering Heights
768,minute!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing",Wuthering Heights
768,tendency to sob.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,” I interrupted,",Wuthering Heights
768,“since she repents of her sauciness. It would do you a great deal of,Wuthering Heights
768,good: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“A companion!” he cried; “when she hates me, and does not think me fit",Wuthering Heights
768,"to wipe her shoon! Nay, if it made me a king, I’d not be scorned for",Wuthering Heights
768,seeking her good-will any more.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!” wept Cathy, no",Wuthering Heights
768,longer disguising her trouble. “You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff,Wuthering Heights
768,"does, and more.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You’re a damned liar,” began Earnshaw: “why have I made him angry, by",Wuthering Heights
768,"taking your part, then, a hundred times? and that when you sneered at",Wuthering Heights
768,"and despised me, and—Go on plaguing me, and I’ll step in yonder, and",Wuthering Heights
768,say you worried me out of the kitchen!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I didn’t know you took my part,” she answered, drying her eyes; “and I",Wuthering Heights
768,"was miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you",Wuthering Heights
768,to forgive me: what can I do besides?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand. He blackened",Wuthering Heights
768,"and scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely",Wuthering Heights
768,"clenched, and his gaze fixed on the ground. Catherine, by instinct,",Wuthering Heights
768,"must have divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that",Wuthering Heights
768,"prompted this dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant",Wuthering Heights
768,"undecided, she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss. The",Wuthering Heights
768,"little rogue thought I had not seen her, and, drawing back, she took",Wuthering Heights
768,"her former station by the window, quite demurely. I shook my head",Wuthering Heights
768,"reprovingly, and then she blushed and whispered—“Well! what should I",Wuthering Heights
768,"have done, Ellen? He wouldn’t shake hands, and he wouldn’t look: I must",Wuthering Heights
768,show him some way that I like him—that I want to be friends.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful,",Wuthering Heights
768,"for some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and when he did",Wuthering Heights
768,"raise it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white,Wuthering Heights
768,"paper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to",Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mr. Hareton Earnshaw,” she desired me to be her ambassadress, and",Wuthering Heights
768,convey the present to its destined recipient.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And tell him, if he’ll take it, I’ll come and teach him to read it",Wuthering Heights
768,"right,” she said; “and, if he refuse it, I’ll go upstairs, and never",Wuthering Heights
768,tease him again.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my",Wuthering Heights
768,"employer. Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee.",Wuthering Heights
768,"He did not strike it off, either. I returned to my work. Catherine",Wuthering Heights
768,"leaned her head and arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle",Wuthering Heights
768,"of the covering being removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated",Wuthering Heights
768,"herself beside her cousin. He trembled, and his face glowed: all his",Wuthering Heights
768,rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him: he could not,Wuthering Heights
768,"summon courage, at first, to utter a syllable in reply to her",Wuthering Heights
768,"questioning look, and her murmured petition.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Say you forgive me, Hareton, do. You can make me so happy by speaking",Wuthering Heights
768,that little word.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He muttered something inaudible.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And you’ll be my friend?” added Catherine, interrogatively.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nay, you’ll be ashamed of me every day of your life,” he answered;",Wuthering Heights
768,"“and the more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“So you won’t be my friend?” she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and",Wuthering Heights
768,creeping close up.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round",Wuthering Heights
768,"again, I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of",Wuthering Heights
768,"the accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on",Wuthering Heights
768,"both sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their,Wuthering Heights
768,position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home.,Wuthering Heights
768,"He, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated",Wuthering Heights
768,"on the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his",Wuthering Heights
768,shoulder; and confounded at his favourite’s endurance of her proximity:,Wuthering Heights
768,it affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that,Wuthering Heights
768,"night. His emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as",Wuthering Heights
768,"he solemnly spread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with",Wuthering Heights
768,"dirty bank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the day’s",Wuthering Heights
768,transactions. At length he summoned Hareton from his seat.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Tak’ these in to t’ maister, lad,” he said, “and bide there. I’s gang",Wuthering Heights
768,up to my own rahm. This hoile’s neither mensful nor seemly for us: we,Wuthering Heights
768,mun side out and seearch another.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Come, Catherine,” I said, “we must ‘side out’ too: I’ve done my",Wuthering Heights
768,ironing. Are you ready to go?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is not eight o’clock!” she answered, rising unwillingly. “Hareton,",Wuthering Heights
768,"I’ll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I’ll bring some more",Wuthering Heights
768,to-morrow.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak’ into th’ hahse,” said Joseph,",Wuthering Heights
768,"“and it’ll be mitch if yah find ’em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as",Wuthering Heights
768,"she passed Hareton, went singing upstairs: lighter of heart, I venture",Wuthering Heights
768,"to say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps,",Wuthering Heights
768,during her earliest visits to Linton.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered,Wuthering Heights
768,"temporary interruptions. Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and my young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but",Wuthering Heights
768,both their minds tending to the same point—one loving and desiring to,Wuthering Heights
768,"esteem, and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed—they contrived",Wuthering Heights
768,in the end to reach it.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff’s",Wuthering Heights
768,"heart. But now, I’m glad you did not try. The crown of all my wishes",Wuthering Heights
768,will be the union of those two. I shall envy no one on their wedding,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XXXIII,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"On the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his",Wuthering Heights
768,"ordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me,",Wuthering Heights
768,"as heretofore. She got downstairs before me, and out into the garden,",Wuthering Heights
768,where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I,Wuthering Heights
768,"went to bid them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to",Wuthering Heights
768,"clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and",Wuthering Heights
768,they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the,Wuthering Heights
768,Grange.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a,Wuthering Heights
768,brief half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph’s,Wuthering Heights
768,"eye, and she had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of",Wuthering Heights
768,them.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There! That will be all shown to the master,” I exclaimed, “the minute",Wuthering Heights
768,it is discovered. And what excuse have you to offer for taking such,Wuthering Heights
768,liberties with the garden? We shall have a fine explosion on the head,Wuthering Heights
768,"of it: see if we don’t! Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more",Wuthering Heights
768,wit than to go and make that mess at her bidding!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’d forgotten they were Joseph’s,” answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled;",Wuthering Heights
768,“but I’ll tell him I did it.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff. I held the mistress’s post,Wuthering Heights
768,in making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table. Catherine,Wuthering Heights
768,"usually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I",Wuthering Heights
768,presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than,Wuthering Heights
768,she had in her hostility.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Now, mind you don’t talk with and notice your cousin too much,” were",Wuthering Heights
768,my whispered instructions as we entered the room. “It will certainly,Wuthering Heights
768,"annoy Mr. Heathcliff, and he’ll be mad at you both.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m not going to,” she answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in",Wuthering Heights
768,his plate of porridge.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet she went,Wuthering Heights
768,"on teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh.",Wuthering Heights
768,"I frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was",Wuthering Heights
768,"occupied on other subjects than his company, as his countenance",Wuthering Heights
768,"evinced; and she grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with",Wuthering Heights
768,"deep gravity. Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at",Wuthering Heights
768,"last, Hareton uttered a smothered laugh. Mr. Heathcliff started; his",Wuthering Heights
768,eye rapidly surveyed our faces. Catherine met it with her accustomed,Wuthering Heights
768,"look of nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is well you are out of my reach,” he exclaimed. “What fiend",Wuthering Heights
768,"possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal",Wuthering Heights
768,eyes? Down with them! and don’t remind me of your existence again. I,Wuthering Heights
768,thought I had cured you of laughing.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It was me,” muttered Hareton.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What do you say?” demanded the master.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession. Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his breakfast",Wuthering Heights
768,"and his interrupted musing. We had nearly finished, and the two young",Wuthering Heights
768,"people prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further",Wuthering Heights
768,"disturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door,",Wuthering Heights
768,revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage,Wuthering Heights
768,committed on his precious shrubs was detected. He must have seen Cathy,Wuthering Heights
768,"and her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws",Wuthering Heights
768,"worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech",Wuthering Heights
768,"difficult to understand, he began:—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I mun hev’ my wage, and I mun goa! I _hed_ aimed to dee wheare I’d",Wuthering Heights
768,"sarved fur sixty year; and I thowt I’d lug my books up into t’ garret,",Wuthering Heights

768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Now, now, idiot!” interrupted Heathcliff, “cut it short! What’s your",Wuthering Heights
768,grievance? I’ll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly. She may,Wuthering Heights
768,thrust you into the coal-hole for anything I care.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“It’s noan Nelly!” answered Joseph. “I sudn’t shift for Nelly—nasty ill,Wuthering Heights
768,nowt as shoo is. Thank God! _shoo_ cannot stale t’ sowl o’ nob’dy! Shoo,Wuthering Heights

768,"forgotten all I’ve done for him, and made on him, and goan and riven up",Wuthering Heights
768,a whole row o’ t’ grandest currant-trees i’ t’ garden!” and here he,Wuthering Heights
768,"lamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries, and",Wuthering Heights
768,Earnshaw’s ingratitude and dangerous condition.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Is the fool drunk?” asked Mr. Heathcliff. “Hareton, is it you he’s",Wuthering Heights
768,finding fault with?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ve pulled up two or three bushes,” replied the young man; “but I’m",Wuthering Heights
768,going to set ’em again.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And why have you pulled them up?” said the master.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Catherine wisely put in her tongue.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“We wanted to plant some flowers there,” she cried. “I’m the only",Wuthering Heights
768,"person to blame, for I wished him to do it.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And who the devil gave _you_ leave to touch a stick about the place?”,Wuthering Heights
768,"demanded her father-in-law, much surprised. “And who ordered _you_ to",Wuthering Heights
768,"obey her?” he added, turning to Hareton.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The latter was speechless; his cousin replied—“You shouldn’t grudge a,Wuthering Heights
768,"few yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken all my",Wuthering Heights
768,land!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Your land, insolent slut! You never had any,” said Heathcliff.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And my money,” she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime",Wuthering Heights
768,"biting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Silence!” he exclaimed. “Get done, and begone!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And Hareton’s land, and his money,” pursued the reckless thing.",Wuthering Heights
768,“Hareton and I are friends now; and I shall tell him all about you!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights

768,"eyeing her all the while, with an expression of mortal hate.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“If you strike me, Hareton will strike you,” she said; “so you may as",Wuthering Heights
768,well sit down.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I’ll strike him to",Wuthering Heights
768,"hell,” thundered Heathcliff. “Damnable witch! dare you pretend to rouse",Wuthering Heights
768,him against me? Off with her! Do you hear? Fling her into the kitchen!,Wuthering Heights
768,"I’ll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into my sight again!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Drag her away!” he cried, savagely. “Are you staying to talk?” And he",Wuthering Heights
768,approached to execute his own command.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He’ll not obey you, wicked man, any more,” said Catherine; “and he’ll",Wuthering Heights
768,soon detest you as much as I do.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Wisht! wisht!” muttered the young man, reproachfully; “I will not hear",Wuthering Heights
768,you speak so to him. Have done.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“But you won’t let him strike me?” she cried.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Come, then,” he whispered earnestly.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,It was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Now, _you_ go!” he said to Earnshaw. “Accursed witch! this time she",Wuthering Heights
768,has provoked me when I could not bear it; and I’ll make her repent it,Wuthering Heights
768,for ever!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her locks,",Wuthering Heights
768,entreating him not to hurt her that once. Heathcliff’s black eyes,Wuthering Heights
768,"flashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just",Wuthering Heights
768,"worked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers",Wuthering Heights
768,"relaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed",Wuthering Heights
768,"intently in her face. Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a",Wuthering Heights
768,"moment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine,",Wuthering Heights
768,"said, with assumed calmness—“You must learn to avoid putting me in a",Wuthering Heights
768,"passion, or I shall really murder you some time! Go with Mrs. Dean, and",Wuthering Heights
768,keep with her; and confine your insolence to her ears. As to Hareton,Wuthering Heights
768,"Earnshaw, if I see him listen to you, I’ll send him seeking his bread",Wuthering Heights
768,where he can get it! Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar.,Wuthering Heights
768,"Nelly, take her; and leave me, all of you! Leave me!”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; the,Wuthering Heights
768,"other followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner.",Wuthering Heights
768,"I had counselled Catherine to dine upstairs; but, as soon as he",Wuthering Heights
768,"perceived her vacant seat, he sent me to call her. He spoke to none of",Wuthering Heights
768,"us, ate very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that",Wuthering Heights
768,he should not return before evening.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The two new friends established themselves in the house during his,Wuthering Heights
768,"absence; where I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin, on her",Wuthering Heights
768,offering a revelation of her father-in-law’s conduct to his father. He,Wuthering Heights
768,said he wouldn’t suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if,Wuthering Heights
768,"he were the devil, it didn’t signify; he would stand by him; and he’d",Wuthering Heights
768,"rather she would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff. Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to,Wuthering Heights
768,"make her hold her tongue, by asking how she would like _him_ to speak",Wuthering Heights
768,ill of her father? Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the,Wuthering Heights
768,master’s reputation home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger,Wuthering Heights
768,"than reason could break—chains, forged by habit, which it would be",Wuthering Heights
768,"cruel to attempt to loosen. She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in",Wuthering Heights
768,avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning,Wuthering Heights
768,Heathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to,Wuthering Heights
768,"raise a bad spirit between him and Hareton: indeed, I don’t believe she",Wuthering Heights
768,"has ever breathed a syllable, in the latter’s hearing, against her",Wuthering Heights
768,oppressor since.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"When this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as",Wuthering Heights
768,busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher. I,Wuthering Heights
768,"came in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so",Wuthering Heights
768,"soothed and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got",Wuthering Heights
768,"on. You know, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long",Wuthering Heights
768,"been proud of one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of",Wuthering Heights
768,"equal satisfaction. His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off",Wuthering Heights
768,rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been,Wuthering Heights
768,bred; and Catherine’s sincere commendations acted as a spur to his,Wuthering Heights
768,"industry. His brightening mind brightened his features, and added",Wuthering Heights
768,spirit and nobility to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same,Wuthering Heights
768,individual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at,Wuthering Heights
768,"Wuthering Heights, after her expedition to the Crags. While I admired",Wuthering Heights
768,"and they laboured, dusk drew on, and with it returned the master. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"came upon us quite unexpectedly, entering by the front way, and had a",Wuthering Heights
768,"full view of the whole three, ere we could raise our heads to glance at",Wuthering Heights
768,"him. Well, I reflected, there was never a pleasanter, or more harmless",Wuthering Heights
768,sight; and it will be a burning shame to scold them. The red fire-light,Wuthering Heights
768,"glowed on their two bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with",Wuthering Heights
768,"the eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three and she",Wuthering Heights
768,"eighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel and learn, that neither",Wuthering Heights
768,experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps",Wuthering Heights
768,"you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they",Wuthering Heights
768,are those of Catherine Earnshaw. The present Catherine has no other,Wuthering Heights
768,"likeness to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of",Wuthering Heights
768,"the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or",Wuthering Heights
768,not. With Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at,Wuthering Heights
768,"all times, _then_ it was particularly striking; because his senses were",Wuthering Heights
768,"alert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity. I suppose",Wuthering Heights
768,this resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in,Wuthering Heights
768,evident agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young,Wuthering Heights
768,"man: or, I should say, altered its character; for it was there yet. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"took the book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then",Wuthering Heights
768,returned it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her,Wuthering Heights
768,"companion lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart",Wuthering Heights
768,"also, but he bid me sit still.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is a poor conclusion, is it not?” he observed, having brooded",Wuthering Heights
768,a while on the scene he had just witnessed: “an absurd termination to,Wuthering Heights
768,my violent exertions? I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two,Wuthering Heights
768,"houses, and train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"when everything is ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a",Wuthering Heights
768,slate off either roof has vanished! My old enemies have not beaten me;,Wuthering Heights
768,now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their,Wuthering Heights
768,representatives: I could do it; and none could hinder me. But where is,Wuthering Heights
768,the use? I don’t care for striking: I can’t take the trouble to raise,Wuthering Heights
768,my hand! That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole time only to,Wuthering Heights
768,exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity. It is far from being the case: I,Wuthering Heights
768,"have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle",Wuthering Heights
768,to destroy for nothing.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I’m in its shadow at",Wuthering Heights
768,present. I take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly,Wuthering Heights
768,remember to eat and drink. Those two who have left the room are the,Wuthering Heights
768,only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and,Wuthering Heights
768,"that appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony. About _her_ I won’t",Wuthering Heights
768,speak; and I don’t desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were,Wuthering Heights
768,invisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations. _He_ moves,Wuthering Heights
768,"me differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I’d",Wuthering Heights
768,never see him again! You’ll perhaps think me rather inclined to become,Wuthering Heights
768,"so,” he added, making an effort to smile, “if I try to describe the",Wuthering Heights
768,thousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies.,Wuthering Heights
768,But you’ll not talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally,Wuthering Heights
768,"secluded in itself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a",Wuthering Heights
768,"human being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would",Wuthering Heights
768,have been impossible to have accosted him rationally. In the first,Wuthering Heights
768,"place, his startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with",Wuthering Heights
768,"her. That, however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my",Wuthering Heights
768,"imagination, is actually the least: for what is not connected with her",Wuthering Heights
768,"to me? and what does not recall her? I cannot look down to this floor,",Wuthering Heights
768,"but her features are shaped in the flags! In every cloud, in every",Wuthering Heights
768,"tree—filling the air at night, and caught by glimpses in every object",Wuthering Heights
768,by day—I am surrounded with her image! The most ordinary faces of men,Wuthering Heights
768,and women—my own features—mock me with a resemblance. The entire world,Wuthering Heights
768,"is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I",Wuthering Heights
768,"have lost her! Well, Hareton’s aspect was the ghost of my immortal",Wuthering Heights
768,"love; of my wild endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride,",Wuthering Heights
768,"my happiness, and my anguish—",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you,Wuthering Heights
768,"know why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no",Wuthering Heights
768,benefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer: and it,Wuthering Heights
768,partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on,Wuthering Heights
768,together. I can give them no attention any more.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“But what do you mean by a _change_, Mr. Heathcliff?” I said, alarmed",Wuthering Heights
768,"at his manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses,",Wuthering Heights
768,"nor dying, according to my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy;",Wuthering Heights
768,"and, as to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on",Wuthering Heights
768,"dark things, and entertaining odd fancies. He might have had a",Wuthering Heights
768,monomania on the subject of his departed idol; but on every other point,Wuthering Heights
768,his wits were as sound as mine.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I shall not know that till it comes,” he said; “I’m only half",Wuthering Heights
768,conscious of it now.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You have no feeling of illness, have you?” I asked.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, Nelly, I have not,” he answered.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Then you are not afraid of death?” I pursued.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Afraid? No!” he replied. “I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment,",Wuthering Heights
768,nor a hope of death. Why should I? With my hard constitution and,Wuthering Heights
768,"temperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"probably _shall_, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black",Wuthering Heights
768,hair on my head. And yet I cannot continue in this condition! I have to,Wuthering Heights
768,remind myself to breathe—almost to remind my heart to beat! And it is,Wuthering Heights
768,like bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the,Wuthering Heights
768,slightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I,Wuthering Heights
768,"notice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one",Wuthering Heights
768,"universal idea. I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties",Wuthering Heights
768,"are yearning to attain it. They have yearned towards it so long, and so",Wuthering Heights
768,"unwaveringly, that I’m convinced it _will_ be reached—and",Wuthering Heights
768,_soon_—because it has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the,Wuthering Heights
768,anticipation of its fulfilment. My confessions have not relieved me;,Wuthering Heights
768,but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour,Wuthering Heights
768,which I show. O God! It is a long fight; I wish it were over!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I",Wuthering Heights
768,"was inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had",Wuthering Heights
768,turned his heart to an earthly hell. I wondered greatly how it would,Wuthering Heights
768,"end. Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind, even by",Wuthering Heights
768,"looks, it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt: he asserted it",Wuthering Heights
768,"himself; but not a soul, from his general bearing, would have",Wuthering Heights
768,"conjectured the fact. You did not when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood: and",Wuthering Heights
768,"at the period of which I speak, he was just the same as then; only",Wuthering Heights
768,"fonder of continued solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in",Wuthering Heights
768,company.,Wuthering Heights

768,CHAPTER XXXIV,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"For some days after that evening, Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at",Wuthering Heights
768,meals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy.,Wuthering Heights
768,"He had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing",Wuthering Heights
768,rather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed,Wuthering Heights
768,sufficient sustenance for him.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"out at the front door. I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning",Wuthering Heights
768,I found he was still away. We were in April then: the weather was sweet,Wuthering Heights
768,"and warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the",Wuthering Heights
768,two dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom. After,Wuthering Heights
768,"breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with",Wuthering Heights
768,my work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled,Wuthering Heights
768,"Hareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and",Wuthering Heights
768,"arrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the",Wuthering Heights
768,influence of Joseph’s complaints. I was comfortably revelling in the,Wuthering Heights
768,"spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my",Wuthering Heights
768,"young lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose",Wuthering Heights
768,"roots for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Heathcliff was coming in. “And he spoke to me,” she added, with a",Wuthering Heights
768,perplexed countenance.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What did he say?” asked Hareton.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“He told me to begone as fast as I could,” she answered. “But he looked",Wuthering Heights
768,so different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at,Wuthering Heights
768,him.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“How?” he inquired.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why, almost bright and cheerful. No, _almost_ nothing—_very much_",Wuthering Heights
768,"excited, and wild, and glad!” she replied.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Night-walking amuses him, then,” I remarked, affecting a careless",Wuthering Heights
768,"manner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain",Wuthering Heights
768,the truth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would,Wuthering Heights
768,not be an every-day spectacle. I framed an excuse to go in. Heathcliff,Wuthering Heights
768,"stood at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly,",Wuthering Heights
768,"he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of",Wuthering Heights
768,his whole face.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Will you have some breakfast?” I said. “You must be hungry, rambling",Wuthering Heights
768,"about all night!” I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not",Wuthering Heights
768,like to ask directly.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, I’m not hungry,” he answered, averting his head, and speaking",Wuthering Heights
768,"rather contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the",Wuthering Heights
768,occasion of his good humour.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I felt perplexed: I didn’t know whether it were not a proper,Wuthering Heights
768,opportunity to offer a bit of admonition.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I don’t think it right to wander out of doors,” I observed, “instead",Wuthering Heights
768,"of being in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season. I",Wuthering Heights
768,"daresay you’ll catch a bad cold, or a fever: you have something the",Wuthering Heights
768,matter with you now!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nothing but what I can bear,” he replied; “and with the greatest",Wuthering Heights
768,"pleasure, provided you’ll leave me alone: get in, and don’t annoy me.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes!” I reflected to myself, “we shall have a fit of illness. I cannot",Wuthering Heights
768,conceive what he has been doing.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"That noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate",Wuthering Heights
768,"from my hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’ve neither cold nor fever, Nelly,” he remarked, in allusion to my",Wuthering Heights
768,morning’s speech; “and I’m ready to do justice to the food you give,Wuthering Heights
768,me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the",Wuthering Heights
768,inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct. He laid them on the,Wuthering Heights
768,"table, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out. We",Wuthering Heights
768,"saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal,",Wuthering Heights
768,and Earnshaw said he’d go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we,Wuthering Heights
768,had grieved him some way.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Well, is he coming?” cried Catherine, when her cousin returned.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Nay,” he answered; “but he’s not angry: he seemed rarely pleased",Wuthering Heights
768,indeed; only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he,Wuthering Heights
768,bid me be off to you: he wondered how I could want the company of,Wuthering Heights
768,anybody else.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he,Wuthering Heights
768,"re-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same",Wuthering Heights
768,unnatural—it was unnatural—appearance of joy under his black brows; the,Wuthering Heights
768,"same bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of",Wuthering Heights
768,"smile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness,",Wuthering Heights
768,"but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates—a strong thrilling, rather than",Wuthering Heights
768,trembling.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should? And I",Wuthering Heights
768,"exclaimed—“Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff? You look",Wuthering Heights
768,uncommonly animated.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Where should good news come from to me?” he said. “I’m animated with,Wuthering Heights
768,"hunger; and, seemingly, I must not eat.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Your dinner is here,” I returned; “why won’t you get it?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I don’t want it now,” he muttered, hastily: “I’ll wait till supper.",Wuthering Heights
768,"And, Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other",Wuthering Heights
768,away from me. I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this,Wuthering Heights
768,place to myself.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Is there some new reason for this banishment?” I inquired. “Tell me,Wuthering Heights
768,"why you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff? Where were you last night? I’m",Wuthering Heights
768,"not putting the question through idle curiosity, but—”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You are putting the question through very idle curiosity,” he",Wuthering Heights
768,"interrupted, with a laugh. “Yet I’ll answer it. Last night I was on the",Wuthering Heights
768,"threshold of hell. To-day, I am within sight of my heaven. I have my",Wuthering Heights
768,eyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me! And now you’d better go!,Wuthering Heights
768,"You’ll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain",Wuthering Heights
768,from prying.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed",Wuthering Heights
768,than ever.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on",Wuthering Heights
768,"his solitude; till, at eight o’clock, I deemed it proper, though",Wuthering Heights
768,"unsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him. He was leaning",Wuthering Heights
768,"against the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was",Wuthering Heights
768,turned to the interior gloom. The fire had smouldered to ashes; the,Wuthering Heights
768,"room was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so",Wuthering Heights
768,"still, that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was",Wuthering Heights
768,"distinguishable, but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or",Wuthering Heights
768,through the large stones which it could not cover. I uttered an,Wuthering Heights
768,"ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced",Wuthering Heights
768,"shutting the casements, one after another, till I came to his.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Must I close this?” I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not",Wuthering Heights
768,stir.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The light flashed on his features as I spoke. Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I",Wuthering Heights
768,cannot express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view! Those,Wuthering Heights
768,"deep black eyes! That smile, and ghastly paleness! It appeared to me,",Wuthering Heights
768,"not Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle",Wuthering Heights
768,"bend towards the wall, and it left me in darkness.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes, close it,” he replied, in his familiar voice. “There, that is",Wuthering Heights
768,"pure awkwardness! Why did you hold the candle horizontally? Be quick,",Wuthering Heights
768,and bring another.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph—“The",Wuthering Heights
768,master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.” For I,Wuthering Heights
768,dared not go in myself again just then.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it",Wuthering Heights
768,"back immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining",Wuthering Heights
768,"that Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till",Wuthering Heights
768,morning. We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to,Wuthering Heights
768,"his ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its",Wuthering Heights
768,"window, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get",Wuthering Heights
768,"through; and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion,",Wuthering Heights
768,of which he had rather we had no suspicion.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“Is he a ghoul or a vampire?” I mused. I had read of such hideous,Wuthering Heights
768,incarnate demons. And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him,Wuthering Heights
768,"in infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost",Wuthering Heights
768,through his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to,Wuthering Heights
768,"that sense of horror. “But where did he come from, the little dark",Wuthering Heights
768,"thing, harboured by a good man to his bane?” muttered Superstition, as",Wuthering Heights
768,"I dozed into unconsciousness. And I began, half dreaming, to weary",Wuthering Heights
768,"myself with imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my",Wuthering Heights
768,"waking meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim",Wuthering Heights
768,"variations; at last, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I",Wuthering Heights
768,"can remember is, being exceedingly vexed at having the task of",Wuthering Heights
768,"dictating an inscription for his monument, and consulting the sexton",Wuthering Heights
768,"about it; and, as he had no surname, and we could not tell his age, we",Wuthering Heights
768,"were obliged to content ourselves with the single word, “Heathcliff.”",Wuthering Heights
768,"That came true: we were. If you enter the kirkyard, you’ll read, on his",Wuthering Heights
768,"headstone, only that, and the date of his death.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Dawn restored me to common sense. I rose, and went into the garden, as",Wuthering Heights
768,"soon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his",Wuthering Heights
768,"window. There were none. “He has stayed at home,” I thought, “and he’ll",Wuthering Heights
768,"be all right to-day.” I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my",Wuthering Heights
768,"usual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the",Wuthering Heights
768,"master came down, for he lay late. They preferred taking it out of",Wuthering Heights
768,"doors, under the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"On my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below. He and Joseph were",Wuthering Heights
768,"conversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute",Wuthering Heights
768,"directions concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"turned his head continually aside, and had the same excited expression,",Wuthering Heights
768,even more exaggerated. When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in,Wuthering Heights
768,"the place he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him.",Wuthering Heights
768,"He drew it nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at",Wuthering Heights
768,"the opposite wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up",Wuthering Heights
768,"and down, with glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest",Wuthering Heights
768,that he stopped breathing during half a minute together.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Come now,” I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand, “eat and",Wuthering Heights
768,"drink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He didn’t notice me, and yet he smiled. I’d rather have seen him gnash",Wuthering Heights
768,his teeth than smile so.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Mr. Heathcliff! master!” I cried, “don’t, for God’s sake, stare as if",Wuthering Heights
768,you saw an unearthly vision.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Don’t, for God’s sake, shout so loud,” he replied. “Turn round, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"tell me, are we by ourselves?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Of course,” was my answer; “of course we are.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Still, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure. With a",Wuthering Heights
768,sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the,Wuthering Heights
768,"breakfast things, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Now, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded",Wuthering Heights
768,"him alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two",Wuthering Heights
768,"yards’ distance. And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both",Wuthering Heights
768,"pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet",Wuthering Heights
768,"raptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea. The",Wuthering Heights
768,"fancied object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with",Wuthering Heights
768,"unwearied diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned",Wuthering Heights
768,away. I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if,Wuthering Heights
768,"he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he",Wuthering Heights
768,"stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched",Wuthering Heights
768,"before they reached it, and remained on the table, forgetful of their",Wuthering Heights
768,aim.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention",Wuthering Heights
768,"from its engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up,",Wuthering Heights
768,asking why I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his,Wuthering Heights
768,meals? and saying that on the next occasion I needn’t wait: I might set,Wuthering Heights
768,"the things down and go. Having uttered these words he left the house,",Wuthering Heights
768,"slowly sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the",Wuthering Heights
768,gate.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. I did not retire to,Wuthering Heights
768,"rest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep. He returned after",Wuthering Heights
768,"midnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room",Wuthering Heights
768,"beneath. I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and",Wuthering Heights
768,"descended. It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a",Wuthering Heights
768,hundred idle misgivings.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff’s step, restlessly measuring the floor,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a",Wuthering Heights
768,groan. He muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was,Wuthering Heights
768,"the name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or",Wuthering Heights
768,suffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and,Wuthering Heights
768,"earnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul. I had not courage to",Wuthering Heights
768,walk straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his,Wuthering Heights
768,"reverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and",Wuthering Heights
768,began to scrape the cinders. It drew him forth sooner than I expected.,Wuthering Heights
768,"He opened the door immediately, and said—“Nelly, come here—is it",Wuthering Heights
768,morning? Come in with your light.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is striking four,” I answered. “You want a candle to take upstairs:",Wuthering Heights
768,you might have lit one at this fire.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, I don’t wish to go upstairs,” he said. “Come in, and kindle _me_ a",Wuthering Heights
768,"fire, and do anything there is to do about the room.”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,” I replied,",Wuthering Heights
768,getting a chair and the bellows.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his",Wuthering Heights
768,heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for,Wuthering Heights
768,common breathing between.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“When day breaks I’ll send for Green,” he said; “I wish to make some",Wuthering Heights
768,"legal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters,",Wuthering Heights
768,and while I can act calmly. I have not written my will yet; and how to,Wuthering Heights
768,leave my property I cannot determine. I wish I could annihilate it from,Wuthering Heights
768,the face of the earth.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,” I interposed. “Let your will be",Wuthering Heights
768,a while: you’ll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet! I,Wuthering Heights
768,"never expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at",Wuthering Heights
768,"present, marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own",Wuthering Heights
768,fault. The way you’ve passed these three last days might knock up a,Wuthering Heights
768,"Titan. Do take some food, and some repose. You need only look at",Wuthering Heights
768,yourself in a glass to see how you require both. Your cheeks are,Wuthering Heights
768,"hollow, and your eyes blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger",Wuthering Heights
768,and going blind with loss of sleep.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,” he replied. “I assure",Wuthering Heights
768,"you it is through no settled designs. I’ll do both, as soon as I",Wuthering Heights
768,possibly can. But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water,Wuthering Heights
768,"rest within arms’ length of the shore! I must reach it first, and then",Wuthering Heights
768,"I’ll rest. Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my",Wuthering Heights
768,"injustices, I’ve done no injustice, and I repent of nothing. I’m too",Wuthering Heights
768,"happy; and yet I’m not happy enough. My soul’s bliss kills my body, but",Wuthering Heights
768,does not satisfy itself.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Happy, master?” I cried. “Strange happiness! If you would hear me",Wuthering Heights
768,"without being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you",Wuthering Heights
768,happier.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“What is that?” he asked. “Give it.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,” I said, “that from the time you were",Wuthering Heights
768,"thirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and",Wuthering Heights
768,probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period. You,Wuthering Heights
768,"must have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have",Wuthering Heights
768,space to search it now. Could it be hurtful to send for some one—some,Wuthering Heights
768,"minister of any denomination, it does not matter which—to explain it,",Wuthering Heights
768,and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how,Wuthering Heights
768,"unfit you will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before",Wuthering Heights
768,you die?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I’m rather obliged than angry, Nelly,” he said, “for you remind me of",Wuthering Heights
768,the manner in which I desire to be buried. It is to be carried to the,Wuthering Heights
768,"churchyard in the evening. You and Hareton may, if you please,",Wuthering Heights
768,"accompany me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys",Wuthering Heights
768,my directions concerning the two coffins! No minister need come; nor,Wuthering Heights
768,need anything be said over me.—I tell you I have nearly attained _my_,Wuthering Heights
768,heaven; and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that",Wuthering Heights
768,"means, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?” I",Wuthering Heights
768,"said, shocked at his godless indifference. “How would you like it?”",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“They won’t do that,” he replied: “if they did, you must have me",Wuthering Heights
768,"removed secretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically,",Wuthering Heights
768,that the dead are not annihilated!”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired,Wuthering Heights
768,"to his den, and I breathed freer. But in the afternoon, while Joseph",Wuthering Heights
768,"and Hareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and,",Wuthering Heights
768,"with a wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody",Wuthering Heights
768,with him. I declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and,Wuthering Heights
768,"manner frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be",Wuthering Heights
768,his companion alone.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“I believe you think me a fiend,” he said, with his dismal laugh:",Wuthering Heights
768,“something too horrible to live under a decent roof.” Then turning to,Wuthering Heights
768,"Catherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he",Wuthering Heights
768,"added, half sneeringly,—“Will _you_ come, chuck? I’ll not hurt you. No!",Wuthering Heights
768,"to you I’ve made myself worse than the devil. Well, there is _one_ who",Wuthering Heights
768,"won’t shrink from my company! By God! she’s relentless. Oh, damn it!",Wuthering Heights
768,It’s unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear—even mine.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,He solicited the society of no one more. At dusk he went into his,Wuthering Heights
768,"chamber. Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard",Wuthering Heights
768,him groaning and murmuring to himself. Hareton was anxious to enter;,Wuthering Heights
768,"but I bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him. When",Wuthering Heights
768,"he came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found",Wuthering Heights
768,"it locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned. He was better, and would be",Wuthering Heights
768,left alone; so the doctor went away.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"The following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till",Wuthering Heights
768,"day-dawn; and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed",Wuthering Heights
768,"the master’s window swinging open, and the rain driving straight in. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"cannot be in bed, I thought: those showers would drench him through. He",Wuthering Heights
768,"must either be up or out. But I’ll make no more ado, I’ll go boldly and",Wuthering Heights
768,look.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to",Wuthering Heights
768,"unclose the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them",Wuthering Heights
768,"aside, I peeped in. Mr. Heathcliff was there—laid on his back. His eyes",Wuthering Heights
768,"met mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile. I",Wuthering Heights
768,could not think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with,Wuthering Heights
768,"rain; the bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still. The lattice,",Wuthering Heights
768,"flapping to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no",Wuthering Heights
768,"blood trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I",Wuthering Heights
768,could doubt no more: he was dead and stark!,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I,Wuthering Heights
768,"tried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful,",Wuthering Heights
768,life-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it. They would,Wuthering Heights
768,not shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and,Wuthering Heights
768,"sharp white teeth sneered too! Taken with another fit of cowardice, I",Wuthering Heights
768,"cried out for Joseph. Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but",Wuthering Heights
768,resolutely refused to meddle with him.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Th’ divil’s harried off his soul,” he cried, “and he may hev’ his",Wuthering Heights
768,"carcass into t’ bargin, for aught I care! Ech! what a wicked ’un he",Wuthering Heights
768,"looks, girning at death!” and the old sinner grinned in mockery. I",Wuthering Heights
768,thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly,Wuthering Heights
768,"composing himself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and",Wuthering Heights
768,returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were,Wuthering Heights
768,restored to their rights.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred,Wuthering Heights
768,"to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness. But poor Hareton,",Wuthering Heights
768,"the most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much. He sat by",Wuthering Heights
768,"the corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest. He pressed its hand,",Wuthering Heights
768,"and kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from",Wuthering Heights
768,contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs,Wuthering Heights
768,"naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master,Wuthering Heights
768,died. I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four,Wuthering Heights
768,"days, fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he",Wuthering Heights
768,did not abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange,Wuthering Heights
768,"illness, not the cause.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished.",Wuthering Heights
768,"Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin,",Wuthering Heights
768,comprehended the whole attendance. The six men departed when they had,Wuthering Heights
768,"let it down into the grave: we stayed to see it covered. Hareton, with",Wuthering Heights
768,"a streaming face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould",Wuthering Heights
768,himself: at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion,Wuthering Heights
768,"mounds—and I hope its tenant sleeps as soundly. But the country folks,",Wuthering Heights
768,"if you ask them, would swear on the Bible that he _walks_: there are",Wuthering Heights
768,"those who speak to having met him near the church, and on the moor, and",Wuthering Heights
768,"even within this house. Idle tales, you’ll say, and so say I. Yet that",Wuthering Heights
768,old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on ’em looking out,Wuthering Heights
768,of his chamber window on every rainy night since his death:—and an odd,Wuthering Heights
768,thing happened to me about a month ago. I was going to the Grange one,Wuthering Heights
768,"evening—a dark evening, threatening thunder—and, just at the turn of",Wuthering Heights
768,"the Heights, I encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs",Wuthering Heights
768,before him; he was crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were,Wuthering Heights
768,"skittish, and would not be guided.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“What is the matter, my little man?” I asked.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“There’s Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t’ nab,” he blubbered,",Wuthering Heights
768,“un’ I darnut pass ’em.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on, so I bid him",Wuthering Heights
768,take the road lower down. He probably raised the phantoms from,Wuthering Heights
768,"thinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard",Wuthering Heights
768,"his parents and companions repeat. Yet, still, I don’t like being out",Wuthering Heights
768,in the dark now; and I don’t like being left by myself in this grim,Wuthering Heights
768,"house: I cannot help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift",Wuthering Heights
768,to the Grange.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“They are going to the Grange, then?” I said.",Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Yes,” answered Mrs. Dean, “as soon as they are married, and that will",Wuthering Heights
768,be on New Year’s Day.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“And who will live here then?”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep",Wuthering Heights
768,"him company. They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut",Wuthering Heights
768,up.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,“For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?” I observed.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“No, Mr. Lockwood,” said Nelly, shaking her head. “I believe the dead",Wuthering Heights
768,are at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"“_They_ are afraid of nothing,” I grumbled, watching their approach",Wuthering Heights
768,"through the window. “Together, they would brave Satan and all his",Wuthering Heights
768,legions.”,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look",Wuthering Heights
768,"at the moon—or, more correctly, at each other by her light—I felt",Wuthering Heights
768,"irresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance",Wuthering Heights
768,"into the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my",Wuthering Heights
768,"rudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door;",Wuthering Heights
768,and so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his,Wuthering Heights
768,"fellow-servant’s gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised",Wuthering Heights
768,me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his,Wuthering Heights
768,feet.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the,Wuthering Heights
768,"kirk. When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even",Wuthering Heights
768,in seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and,Wuthering Heights
768,"slates jutted off, here and there, beyond the right line of the roof,",Wuthering Heights
768,to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next",Wuthering Heights
768,"the moor: the middle one grey, and half buried in heath; Edgar Linton’s",Wuthering Heights
768,only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff’s,Wuthering Heights
768,still bare.,Wuthering Heights
768,,Wuthering Heights
768,"I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths",Wuthering Heights
768,"fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind",Wuthering Heights
768,"breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever",Wuthering Heights
768,imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.,Wuthering Heights

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving,Pride and Prejudice
1342,by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,brings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,proper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"unusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"difficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite",Pride and Prejudice
1342,delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might",Pride and Prejudice
1342,very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does,Pride and Prejudice
1342,not want them._,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"would, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present",Pride and Prejudice
1342,book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"I, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most",Pride and Prejudice
1342,eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show",Pride and Prejudice
1342,cause._,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"possesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"regular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident",Pride and Prejudice
1342,could be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de",Pride and Prejudice
1342,théâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"All the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"intrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive,Pride and Prejudice
1342,aversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"delicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"avail himself, appear at once on the stage._",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"will sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite",Pride and Prejudice
1342,consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all,Pride and Prejudice
1342,faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot,Pride and Prejudice
1342,acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one",Pride and Prejudice
1342,should put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what,Pride and Prejudice
1342,seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still",Pride and Prejudice
1342,superior to them._,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"express, and at any particular time likely to be differently",Pride and Prejudice
1342,apprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"greater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,masculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"common subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those,Pride and Prejudice
1342,who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"savagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"protest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"roasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"husband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play",Pride and Prejudice
1342,at blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"days of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"own, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"English language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"every man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,a cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"work her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was immensely the better for it as an artist._,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,combined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature,Pride and Prejudice
1342,painter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"at one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should,Pride and Prejudice
1342,myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,littleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,paint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,feel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"short periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,single failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century,Pride and Prejudice
1342,seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,German to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"English girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when",Pride and Prejudice
1342,ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"taste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost",Pride and Prejudice
1342,touched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey,Pride and Prejudice
1342,even in a black one._,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"only genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"true, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously",Pride and Prejudice
1342,piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can",Pride and Prejudice
1342,shape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book,Pride and Prejudice
1342,only) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"stirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"himself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,breadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"just and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"should put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to Addison in others._,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Collins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ever did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"been said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"distinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"humanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"its selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech",Pride and Prejudice
1342,or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions",Pride and Prejudice
1342,are historically true._,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily,Pride and Prejudice
1342,exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"figures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me",Pride and Prejudice
1342,very faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"birth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Powerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"rich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"themselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Miss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"always have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,even Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,or when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Let us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"related as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,result of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"readers the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,they are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction,Pride and Prejudice
1342,outside of these four._,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"difficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely",Pride and Prejudice
1342,amusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of,Pride and Prejudice

1342,his falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,cannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come",Pride and Prejudice
1342,husband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"phenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_,Pride and Prejudice
1342,allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"except the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,about her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"strong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give,Pride and Prejudice
1342,at least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“scratches,” and she never attacks first. Some of the merest",Pride and Prejudice
1342,obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"speeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"serious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"final ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable. Then",Pride and Prejudice
1342,too she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herself,Pride and Prejudice
1342,or anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"kind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,been heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons,Pride and Prejudice
1342,who ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,injury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family,Pride and Prejudice
1342,aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten",Pride and Prejudice

1342,much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely",Pride and Prejudice
1342,looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust",Pride and Prejudice
1342,which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his",Pride and Prejudice

1342,himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.",Pride and Prejudice

1342,The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most,Pride and Prejudice
1342,accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised,Pride and Prejudice
1342,such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,had a very different story to hear.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,others! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"very little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private,Pride and Prejudice
1342,seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,themselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their,Pride and Prejudice
1342,memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,acquired by trade.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,purchase.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider",Pride and Prejudice
1342,his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"deficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually,Pride and Prejudice
1342,giving offence.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently,Pride and Prejudice
1342,characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier,Pride and Prejudice
1342,girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too,Pride and Prejudice
1342,much.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,courteous.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest,Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Lucas.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose",Pride and Prejudice
1342,on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are,Pride and Prejudice
1342,very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,discover it too.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"it, he must find it out.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should,Pride and Prejudice
1342,therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling",Pride and Prejudice
1342,in love as much as she chooses.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But",Pride and Prejudice
1342,these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its",Pride and Prejudice
1342,reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite,Pride and Prejudice
1342,enough to make her understand his character.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might",Pride and Prejudice
1342,only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must,Pride and Prejudice
1342,remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four,Pride and Prejudice
1342,evenings may do a great deal.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your,Pride and Prejudice
1342,life.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some,Pride and Prejudice
1342,interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely,Pride and Prejudice
1342,allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered",Pride and Prejudice
1342,uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To,Pride and Prejudice
1342,this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to dance with.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,assembled.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked",Pride and Prejudice
1342,being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling,Pride and Prejudice
1342,herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley",Pride and Prejudice
1342,began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"thought the same, and added,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent",Pride and Prejudice
1342,walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really,Pride and Prejudice
1342,looked almost wild.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very",Pride and Prejudice
1342,nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,hide it not doing its office.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and",Pride and Prejudice

1342,far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,room.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is,Pride and Prejudice
1342,despicable.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,continue the subject.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most",Pride and Prejudice
1342,eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so,Pride and Prejudice
1342,unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes,Pride and Prejudice
1342,that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass,Pride and Prejudice
1342,a little longer on your kindness.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sure, will not hear of her removal.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,remains with us.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest",Pride and Prejudice
1342,temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect",Pride and Prejudice
1342,over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hope, though you have but a short lease.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,least that advantage.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,unvarying society.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,observed in them for ever.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_,Pride and Prejudice
1342,going on in the country as in town.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"victory over him, continued her triumph,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"when I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,at all.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,you must acknowledge to be true.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few",Pride and Prejudice
1342,neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_,Pride and Prejudice
1342,is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very,Pride and Prejudice
1342,important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Did Charlotte dine with you?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own",Pride and Prejudice
1342,work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Charlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody",Pride and Prejudice
1342,better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own,Pride and Prejudice
1342,partiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first",Pride and Prejudice
1342,discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth,Pride and Prejudice
1342,tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming,Pride and Prejudice
1342,into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose",Pride and Prejudice
1342,affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,indirect boast.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any",Pride and Prejudice
1342,attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very",Pride and Prejudice
1342,laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless",Pride and Prejudice
1342,precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you,Pride and Prejudice
1342,would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my",Pride and Prejudice

1342,afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and",Pride and Prejudice

1342,Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth",Pride and Prejudice
1342,for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,seated herself.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked,Pride and Prejudice
1342,him too little to care for his approbation.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell",Pride and Prejudice

1342,“Indeed I do not dare.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were,Pride and Prejudice
1342,during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,acquaintance with spirit.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed,Pride and Prejudice
1342,himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great",Pride and Prejudice
1342,delight.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bennet.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"question and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"is to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,an excellent library.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"towards him and said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasure.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"thing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send",Pride and Prejudice
1342,round my cards.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably,Pride and Prejudice
1342,tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much,Pride and Prejudice
1342,more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,day.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,near so much like a ball.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"turning to Elizabeth, said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so,Pride and Prejudice
1342,long in one attitude.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley",Pride and Prejudice
1342,succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked,Pride and Prejudice
1342,up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,interfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,meaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask",Pride and Prejudice
1342,nothing about it.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,two motives.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon",Pride and Prejudice
1342,as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"completely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better",Pride and Prejudice
1342,as I sit by the fire.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We",Pride and Prejudice
1342,can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Darcy may hug himself.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,laugh.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may",Pride and Prejudice
1342,be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"least not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where,Pride and Prejudice
1342,she felt herself to be right.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He,Pride and Prejudice
1342,wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration,Pride and Prejudice
1342,should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke",Pride and Prejudice
1342,ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleased,Pride and Prejudice
1342,with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,pay.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask,Pride and Prejudice
1342,whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"moment, or are the result of previous study?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,give them as unstudied an air as possible.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful,Pride and Prejudice
1342,acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected",Pride and Prejudice
1342,prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found",Pride and Prejudice
1342,them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own",Pride and Prejudice
1342,part.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the day before, was now high in her good graces.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,go.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a shop window, could recall them.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking",Pride and Prejudice
1342,with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted,Pride and Prejudice
1342,only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,impossible not to long to know.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,invitation.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good,Pride and Prejudice
1342,breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn",Pride and Prejudice
1342,would come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips,Pride and Prejudice
1342,protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,understand.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten",Pride and Prejudice
1342,thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth could not but look surprised.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting",Pride and Prejudice
1342,yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"four days in the same house with him, and I think him very",Pride and Prejudice
1342,disagreeable.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being",Pride and Prejudice
1342,agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him,Pride and Prejudice
1342,too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find,Pride and Prejudice
1342,him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond",Pride and Prejudice
1342,their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,ill-tempered man.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Wickham only shook his head.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,likely to be in this country much longer.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will,Pride and Prejudice
1342,not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men",Pride and Prejudice

1342,in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,memory of his father.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,very intelligible gallantry.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great",Pride and Prejudice
1342,attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were speaking of just now.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Indeed!”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given",Pride and Prejudice
1342,elsewhere.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,will be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"different sort of men, and that he hates me.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than",Pride and Prejudice
1342,ever as he expressed them.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can",Pride and Prejudice
1342,have induced him to behave so cruelly?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of preference which was often given me.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked,Pride and Prejudice

1342,must be dreadful.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"with--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has,Pride and Prejudice
1342,connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger,Pride and Prejudice
1342,impulses even than pride.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Not at all.”,Pride and Prejudice

1342,Darcy is.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,something for fortune and figure.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were,Pride and Prejudice
1342,made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,make herself uneasy.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a",Pride and Prejudice

1342,am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady",Pride and Prejudice

1342,little matters.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked,Pride and Prejudice

1342,reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who",Pride and Prejudice
1342,chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Wickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done",Pride and Prejudice
1342,gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The,Pride and Prejudice
1342,possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,otherwise explained.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to",Pride and Prejudice

1342,without actual blame on either side.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his",Pride and Prejudice

1342,The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every,Pride and Prejudice
1342,female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,had no disinclination for it.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who,Pride and Prejudice
1342,consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,everybody.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,dance.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can",Pride and Prejudice
1342,have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair",Pride and Prejudice
1342,cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being,Pride and Prejudice
1342,engaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins,Pride and Prejudice
1342,instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses",Pride and Prejudice
1342,for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some,Pride and Prejudice
1342,trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Tuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than",Pride and Prejudice
1342,might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"smile,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if",Pride and Prejudice
1342,he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away",Pride and Prejudice
1342,with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"distress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,release from him was ecstasy.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mind: Charlotte tried to console her.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find,Pride and Prejudice
1342,a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,evil.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant",Pride and Prejudice
1342,in the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,with--,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"room, or the number of couples.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,said.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_now_ we may be silent.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,trouble of saying as little as possible.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,imagine that you are gratifying mine?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I must not decide on my own performance.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just",Pride and Prejudice
1342,been forming a new acquaintance.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"features, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"constrained manner said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,is less certain.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,his life.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,his dancing and his partner.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very",Pride and Prejudice
1342,superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"disgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,him _conditionally_ only.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,both gentlemen as I did before.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate",Pride and Prejudice
1342,as to make a most important discovery.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now",Pride and Prejudice
1342,in the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would,Pride and Prejudice
1342,have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total,Pride and Prejudice
1342,ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him,Pride and Prejudice
1342,that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"speaking, replied thus,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference",Pride and Prejudice
1342,between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank,Pride and Prejudice
1342,in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"same time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform",Pride and Prejudice
1342,what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education,Pride and Prejudice
1342,and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Collins then returned to Elizabeth.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made,Pride and Prejudice
1342,her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring",Pride and Prejudice
1342,even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within,Pride and Prejudice
1342,one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She,Pride and Prejudice
1342,concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,chance of it.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible",Pride and Prejudice
1342,whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say,Pride and Prejudice
1342,nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,so doing.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,steady gravity.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who",Pride and Prejudice
1342,had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent,Pride and Prejudice
1342,entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving",Pride and Prejudice
1342,amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute",Pride and Prejudice
1342,began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making",Pride and Prejudice
1342,as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance,Pride and Prejudice
1342,that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who,Pride and Prejudice
1342,should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or",Pride and Prejudice
1342,finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should",Pride and Prejudice
1342,have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend",Pride and Prejudice
1342,himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining,Pride and Prejudice
1342,close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to herself.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,it.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how",Pride and Prejudice
1342,heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful,Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"waiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,go the next day for a short time.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four,Pride and Prejudice
1342,months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having",Pride and Prejudice
1342,no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,course of this morning?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bennet instantly answered,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh dear! Yes, certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"called out,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse",Pride and Prejudice
1342,me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am,Pride and Prejudice
1342,going away myself.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” And",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Collins.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You",Pride and Prejudice
1342,would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little,Pride and Prejudice
1342,unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected,Pride and Prejudice
1342,mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my,Pride and Prejudice
1342,future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"he continued,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling,Pride and Prejudice
1342,patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked,Pride and Prejudice
1342,too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect",Pride and Prejudice
1342,which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general,Pride and Prejudice
1342,intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well",Pride and Prejudice
1342,aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline",Pride and Prejudice
1342,them.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"third time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so,Pride and Prejudice
1342,daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second,Pride and Prejudice
1342,time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"would make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,situation.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all,Pride and Prejudice
1342,disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"economy, and other amiable qualifications.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"addressed her,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,female character.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me",Pride and Prejudice
1342,exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,may convince you of its being one.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are",Pride and Prejudice
1342,circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would,Pride and Prejudice
1342,rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect,Pride and Prejudice
1342,forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the",Pride and Prejudice

1342,from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been",Pride and Prejudice

1342,and could not help saying so.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to",Pride and Prejudice

1342,His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,from Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear,Pride and Prejudice
1342,what she says.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most,Pride and Prejudice
1342,unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these,Pride and Prejudice
1342,high-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their,Pride and Prejudice
1342,absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon",Pride and Prejudice
1342,cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful",Pride and Prejudice
1342,intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater,Pride and Prejudice
1342,satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,them.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend",Pride and Prejudice
1342,his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"already there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux",Pride and Prejudice
1342,will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,whom we shall deprive you.’,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which,Pride and Prejudice
1342,particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely",Pride and Prejudice
1342,less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still,Pride and Prejudice
1342,more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being,Pride and Prejudice
1342,hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them",Pride and Prejudice
1342,unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most",Pride and Prejudice
1342,capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most,Pride and Prejudice
1342,kindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,subject?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Most willingly.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is,Pride and Prejudice
1342,in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,does not care about you.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Jane shook her head.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"together can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest",Pride and Prejudice
1342,degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived",Pride and Prejudice
1342,herself.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry,Pride and Prejudice
1342,elsewhere?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"by all means, to refuse him.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not hesitate.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider",Pride and Prejudice
1342,your situation with much compassion.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,required. A thousand things may arise in six months.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost,Pride and Prejudice
1342,contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man",Pride and Prejudice
1342,so totally independent of everyone.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,very amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth,Pride and Prejudice
1342,had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards",Pride and Prejudice
1342,herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,character; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must,Pride and Prejudice
1342,guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,establishment were gained.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom",Pride and Prejudice
1342,they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more",Pride and Prejudice
1342,interest than the matter had ever,Pride and Prejudice

1342,[Illustration:,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,James’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two,Pride and Prejudice
1342,sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved,Pride and Prejudice
1342,from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative",Pride and Prejudice
1342,from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good",Pride and Prejudice
1342,luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,publish his prosperous love.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,possible.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"so speedy a return, immediately said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,offending your patroness.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,material a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive",Pride and Prejudice
1342,from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting",Pride and Prejudice
1342,my cousin Elizabeth.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally",Pride and Prejudice
1342,surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very",Pride and Prejudice
1342,agreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility,Pride and Prejudice
1342,as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she could not help crying out,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her composure, and calmly replied,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wished her all imaginable happiness.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,entering the marriage state.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much,Pride and Prejudice
1342,longer; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so,Pride and Prejudice
1342,unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now,Pride and Prejudice
1342,accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot,Pride and Prejudice
1342,she had chosen.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne,Pride and Prejudice
1342,without anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried,Pride and Prejudice
1342,him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,most forbearing courtesy.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two,Pride and Prejudice
1342,points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could,Pride and Prejudice
1342,console and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without,Pride and Prejudice
1342,scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William,Pride and Prejudice
1342,or Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,could at all forgive their daughter.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,more foolish than his daughter!,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said,Pride and Prejudice
1342,less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to spread at Meryton.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,enough to drive happiness away.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them,Pride and Prejudice
1342,mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no,Pride and Prejudice
1342,real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early,Pride and Prejudice
1342,day for making him the happiest of men.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient,Pride and Prejudice
1342,and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued,Pride and Prejudice
1342,absence.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after,Pride and Prejudice
1342,day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous",Pride and Prejudice
1342,falsehood.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the strength of his attachment.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more",Pride and Prejudice
1342,painful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"concealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable,Pride and Prejudice
1342,tranquillity.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them",Pride and Prejudice
1342,from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,     “_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,],Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. She,Pride and Prejudice
1342,complained bitterly of all this to her husband.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the country.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former,Pride and Prejudice
1342,letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the latter with regard to new furniture.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern,Pride and Prejudice
1342,for her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"whatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"not help saying,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,all be as we were before.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said",Pride and Prejudice
1342,nothing.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,has done no harm to anyone but myself.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"or sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,is unaccountable!”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Charlotte’s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else",Pride and Prejudice
1342,could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,danger security for happiness.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy,Pride and Prejudice
1342,ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than,Pride and Prejudice
1342,it does.”,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most",Pride and Prejudice
1342,unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no,Pride and Prejudice
1342,more; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"then. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction",Pride and Prejudice
1342,among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,all expect Jane’s good fortune.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will",Pride and Prejudice
1342,always make the most of it.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,Pride and Prejudice
1342,which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now",Pride and Prejudice
1342,added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was,Pride and Prejudice

1342,Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"side by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day",Pride and Prejudice
1342,would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father",Pride and Prejudice
1342,another letter of thanks.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield",Pride and Prejudice
1342,ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"woman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces. Between the two",Pride and Prejudice

1342,They had frequently been staying with her in town.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They",Pride and Prejudice
1342,had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her,Pride and Prejudice

1342,in it.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the",Pride and Prejudice

1342,offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its",Pride and Prejudice
1342,engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,in the way of procuring.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all",Pride and Prejudice

1342,the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does",Pride and Prejudice
1342,me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into",Pride and Prejudice

1342,not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his,Pride and Prejudice

1342,that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"accompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,The wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never,Pride and Prejudice
1342,address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters,Pride and Prejudice
1342,were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte",Pride and Prejudice
1342,expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most",Pride and Prejudice
1342,friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for her own visit there, to know the rest.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much",Pride and Prejudice
1342,engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Miss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My visit was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall",Pride and Prejudice
1342,soon see them here.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself",Pride and Prejudice
1342,no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister,Pride and Prejudice
1342,will prove what she felt:--,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     sure you will be very comfortable there.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yours, etc.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"review of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,regret what he had thrown away.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune",Pride and Prejudice
1342,permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most,Pride and Prejudice
1342,remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sincerely wish him happy.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"circumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"towards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My,Pride and Prejudice
1342,watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take,Pride and Prejudice
1342,his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,perfect as plan could be.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and pleasing.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"worn out, like his information.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early",Pride and Prejudice
1342,as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,acquaintance.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,complimented her on bearing it so well.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth,Pride and Prejudice
1342,smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw",Pride and Prejudice
1342,instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:,Pride and Prejudice
1342,his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some,Pride and Prejudice
1342,minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,offers of refreshment.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most,Pride and Prejudice
1342,respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out",Pride and Prejudice
1342,with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when,Pride and Prejudice
1342,service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will,Pride and Prejudice
1342,include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,walk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse",Pride and Prejudice
1342,with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their,Pride and Prejudice
1342,visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which,Pride and Prejudice
1342,becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion,Pride and Prejudice
1342,for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank,Pride and Prejudice
1342,preserved.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much",Pride and Prejudice
1342,objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to his presentation at St. James’s.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile",Pride and Prejudice
1342,across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally",Pride and Prejudice
1342,cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,thought she could witness without trepidation.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks",Pride and Prejudice
1342,which he would have thought necessary.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any,Pride and Prejudice
1342,likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her eyes.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth,Pride and Prejudice
1342,looking at in the summer.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish",Pride and Prejudice
1342,nothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every",Pride and Prejudice
1342,subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,her judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"questions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"observed,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bennet?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“A little.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“One of them does.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do",Pride and Prejudice
1342,you draw?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“No, not at all.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“What, none of you?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Not one.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother,Pride and Prejudice
1342,should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“We never had any governess.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home,Pride and Prejudice
1342,without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,idle certainly might.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage",Pride and Prejudice
1342,one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, ma’am, all.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The",Pride and Prejudice
1342,younger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must,Pride and Prejudice
1342,be very young?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon",Pride and Prejudice
1342,younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,marry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth,Pride and Prejudice
1342,as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would,Pride and Prejudice
1342,not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or",Pride and Prejudice
1342,having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes,Pride and Prejudice
1342,and noble names.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were,Pride and Prejudice

1342,Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever",Pride and Prejudice
1342,prevailed on to get out.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding",Pride and Prejudice
1342,out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold",Pride and Prejudice

1342,The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time",Pride and Prejudice
1342,comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"important. Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Miss Lucas and herself.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,never have come so soon to wait upon me.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"courtesied to him, without saying a word.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,She was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see,Pride and Prejudice
1342,whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"house they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,only seen at church.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship received them,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,much more than to any other person in the room.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"moreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"scruple to call out,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid",Pride and Prejudice
1342,a reply.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,if she does not practise a great deal.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,She practises very constantly.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of the house.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made",Pride and Prejudice
1342,no answer.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having",Pride and Prejudice
1342,promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"me. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,intimidate me.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,are not your own.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only four",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,you cannot deny the fact.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,beyond my own party.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"introduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still",Pride and Prejudice
1342,addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"education, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend",Pride and Prejudice
1342,himself to strangers?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"concerns, as I often see done.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers,Pride and Prejudice
1342,as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can,Pride and Prejudice
1342,think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know",Pride and Prejudice
1342,what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to Darcy,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,soon as any eligible purchase offers.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his,Pride and Prejudice

1342,trouble of finding a subject to him.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"He took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable",Pride and Prejudice

1342,Collins first came to Hunsford.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,kindness on a more grateful object.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made",Pride and Prejudice
1342,him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though,Pride and Prejudice
1342,I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,distance of her own family and friends.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was settled _near_ her family.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many",Pride and Prejudice
1342,varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my,Pride and Prejudice
1342,friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the present distance.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot",Pride and Prejudice
1342,have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,been always at Longbourn.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Are you pleased with Kent?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side",Pride and Prejudice
1342,calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and her sister, just returned from their walk. The _tête-à-tête_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"intruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"without saying much to anybody, went away.",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gone. “My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never",Pride and Prejudice
1342,have called on us in this familiar way.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable",Pride and Prejudice
1342,from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended",Pride and Prejudice
1342,him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"favourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,believed he might have the best informed mind.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really",Pride and Prejudice
1342,animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself",Pride and Prejudice
1342,seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,seemed nothing but absence of mind.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking",Pride and Prejudice
1342,or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third,Pride and Prejudice
1342,rencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pales opposite the Parsonage.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"do every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Are you going much farther?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“No, I should have turned in a moment.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage",Pride and Prejudice
1342,together.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He,Pride and Prejudice
1342,arranges the business just as he pleases.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least",Pride and Prejudice
1342,great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems,Pride and Prejudice
1342,more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,dependence.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going,Pride and Prejudice
1342,wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry",Pride and Prejudice
1342,where they like.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often",Pride and Prejudice
1342,do.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,money.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she soon afterwards said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,likes with her.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must",Pride and Prejudice
1342,divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does",Pride and Prejudice
1342,your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,may like to have her own way.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner",Pride and Prejudice
1342,in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare,Pride and Prejudice
1342,say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike",Pride and Prejudice
1342,man--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“What is it you mean?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,would be an unpleasant thing.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself,Pride and Prejudice
1342,on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other",Pride and Prejudice
1342,particulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,lady.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“And what arts did he use to separate them?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He",Pride and Prejudice
1342,only told me what I have now told you.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was so thoughtful.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,judge?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that there was much affection in the case.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other,Pride and Prejudice
1342,people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There,Pride and Prejudice
1342,could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart",Pride and Prejudice
1342,in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,inflicted.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,business in London.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"anything be urged against my father, who, though with some",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a,Pride and Prejudice

1342,shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"spirits, by all that affection could do.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mean to be unhappy about him.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,door-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in an agitated manner, and thus began:--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love,Pride and Prejudice
1342,you.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately,Pride and Prejudice
1342,followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,suit.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,his hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only,Pride and Prejudice
1342,exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and she said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however",Pride and Prejudice
1342,unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,overcoming it after this explanation.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,happiness of a most beloved sister?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"continued,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest",Pride and Prejudice
1342,kind.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening",Pride and Prejudice
1342,with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"With assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,kinder than towards myself.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?,Pride and Prejudice
1342,or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,interest in him?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,misfortunes have been great indeed.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You,Pride and Prejudice
1342,have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed,Pride and Prejudice
1342,for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done,Pride and Prejudice
1342,all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,contempt and ridicule.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"calculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your,Pride and Prejudice
1342,connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose,Pride and Prejudice
1342,condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,more gentlemanlike manner.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way,Pride and Prejudice
1342,that would have tempted me to accept it.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wishes for your health and happiness.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!,Pride and Prejudice
1342,so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost",Pride and Prejudice
1342,incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,attachment had for a moment excited.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,[Illustration],Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations,Pride and Prejudice
1342,which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after",Pride and Prejudice
1342,breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of the gates into the ground.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove",Pride and Prejudice
1342,which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon",Pride and Prejudice
1342,out of sight.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,demand it of your justice.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate",Pride and Prejudice
1342,prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley",Pride and Prejudice
1342,preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But,Pride and Prejudice
1342,it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any,Pride and Prejudice
1342,apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive,Pride and Prejudice
1342,that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite",Pride and Prejudice
1342,them by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"here, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my,Pride and Prejudice
1342,investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or,Pride and Prejudice
1342,fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night,Pride and Prejudice
1342,acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside,Pride and Prejudice
1342,in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid,Pride and Prejudice
1342,any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we",Pride and Prejudice
1342,shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my,Pride and Prejudice
1342,friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them,Pride and Prejudice
1342,earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard",Pride and Prejudice
1342,did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years",Pride and Prejudice
1342,since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you,Pride and Prejudice
1342,only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding",Pride and Prejudice
1342,his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father,Pride and Prejudice
1342,died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living",Pride and Prejudice
1342,might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very,Pride and Prejudice
1342,insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The,Pride and Prejudice
1342,business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection",Pride and Prejudice
1342,between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present",Pride and Prejudice
1342,him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my,Pride and Prejudice
1342,notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty",Pride and Prejudice
1342,thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging,Pride and Prejudice
1342,himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know,Pride and Prejudice
1342,what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did,Pride and Prejudice
1342,she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which,Pride and Prejudice
1342,hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pride and insolence.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings,Pride and Prejudice
1342,were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!",Pride and Prejudice
1342,This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"regard it, that she would never look in it again.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"other, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"not err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’,Pride and Prejudice
1342,continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose,Pride and Prejudice
1342,character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation,Pride and Prejudice
1342,between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions",Pride and Prejudice
1342,with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,always prevent his exposing the son.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His,Pride and Prejudice
1342,attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying",Pride and Prejudice
1342,his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most,Pride and Prejudice
1342,incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man,Pride and Prejudice
1342,as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"prejudiced, absurd.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“How despicably have I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,vanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line",Pride and Prejudice
1342,which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely,Pride and Prejudice
1342,different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,give in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Charlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sensibility.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first",Pride and Prejudice

1342,The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then,Pride and Prejudice
1342,hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,having them all to dine with her.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Ladyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how,Pride and Prejudice
1342,would she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused,Pride and Prejudice
1342,herself.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “I assure,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody",Pride and Prejudice
1342,feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!,Pride and Prejudice
1342,They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"seemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year. His",Pride and Prejudice
1342,attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"company, I am sure.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected",Pride and Prejudice
1342,you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There,Pride and Prejudice
1342,can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,spare you for another fortnight.”,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant",Pride and Prejudice

1342,of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am",Pride and Prejudice
1342,glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be,Pride and Prejudice

1342,Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,and as she did not answer them all herself attention was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"necessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave",Pride and Prejudice
1342,way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,unpleasant recollections.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She,Pride and Prejudice
1342,studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against",Pride and Prejudice
1342,herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or",Pride and Prejudice
1342,feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently",Pride and Prejudice
1342,united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,ever.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any",Pride and Prejudice
1342,could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent,Pride and Prejudice
1342,there; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right,Pride and Prejudice

1342,On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few,Pride and Prejudice

1342,paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet",Pride and Prejudice

1342,certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know",Pride and Prejudice
1342,how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending,Pride and Prejudice
1342,your time unpleasantly.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"solemnity replied,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your,Pride and Prejudice
1342,time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most,Pride and Prejudice
1342,fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"truth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and truth in a few short sentences.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you will",Pride and Prejudice
1342,be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you,Pride and Prejudice
1342,have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear,Pride and Prejudice
1342,that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each,Pride and Prejudice
1342,other.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from,Pride and Prejudice
1342,whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such,Pride and Prejudice
1342,society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"evening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!",Pride and Prejudice

1342,treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought,Pride and Prejudice
1342,we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so,Pride and Prejudice

1342,home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"another reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far",Pride and Prejudice

1342,who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular",Pride and Prejudice
1342,relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his,Pride and Prejudice

1342,The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She,Pride and Prejudice

1342,might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister",Pride and Prejudice
1342,how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than,Pride and Prejudice
1342,a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate,Pride and Prejudice
1342,in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"said she, “though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little",Pride and Prejudice
1342,expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present,Pride and Prejudice
1342,circumstances.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,would judge differently in the affair.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Already arisen!” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What! has she frightened away,Pride and Prejudice
1342,some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such,Pride and Prejudice
1342,squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows",Pride and Prejudice
1342,who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Indeed, you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lydia’s character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal",Pride and Prejudice
1342,contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh, my dear father, can you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,disgrace?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will",Pride and Prejudice
1342,keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance,Pride and Prejudice
1342,even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of her life.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,She was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her",Pride and Prejudice

1342,Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty",Pride and Prejudice
1342,well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"recollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"With an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,say that he was at Rosings?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Nearly three weeks.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“And you saw him frequently?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, almost every day.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"may I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much",Pride and Prejudice
1342,what he ever was.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and anxious attention, while she added,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"accents,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily",Pride and Prejudice
1342,comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter",Pride and Prejudice
1342,him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,has very much at heart.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mutual desire of never meeting again.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation,Pride and Prejudice
1342,between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own,Pride and Prejudice
1342,imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often,Pride and Prejudice
1342,console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal,Pride and Prejudice
1342,enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true",Pride and Prejudice
1342,philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even",Pride and Prejudice
1342,if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little",Pride and Prejudice
1342,other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties,Pride and Prejudice
1342,abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation,Pride and Prejudice
1342,for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother,Pride and Prejudice
1342,and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can,Pride and Prejudice
1342,never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much",Pride and Prejudice
1342,too full of lines under the words to be made public.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment",Pride and Prejudice
1342,should be quartered in Meryton.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again",Pride and Prejudice
1342,within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three,Pride and Prejudice
1342,weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Dovedale, or the Peak.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,and all was soon right again.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next",Pride and Prejudice
1342,morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One,Pride and Prejudice
1342,enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear,Pride and Prejudice
1342,inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,disappointments abroad.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"lay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"former residence, and where she had lately learned that some",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen",Pride and Prejudice
1342,all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"much?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,know.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,country.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,absence of the family were unfavourably answered.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to the scheme.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,[Illustration],Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through",Pride and Prejudice
1342,a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired",Pride and Prejudice
1342,every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high",Pride and Prejudice
1342,woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural",Pride and Prejudice
1342,beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were,Pride and Prejudice
1342,all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wonder at her being where she was.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,furniture of Rosings.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With",Pride and Prejudice
1342,these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"replied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large",Pride and Prejudice
1342,party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,not by any circumstance been delayed a day!,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"miniatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who",Pride and Prejudice
1342,had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,return it.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,other--about eight years ago.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell",Pride and Prejudice
1342,us whether it is like or not.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this,Pride and Prejudice
1342,intimation of her knowing her master.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, very handsome.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,be then. He was very fond of them.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn",Pride and Prejudice
1342,when she was only eight years old.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,accomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,comes here to-morrow with him.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"communicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,master and his sister.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,good enough for him.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,ever since he was four years old.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"grateful to her uncle for saying,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,having such a master.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,world.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just",Pride and Prejudice
1342,as affable to the poor.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"furniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will,Pride and Prejudice
1342,give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle",Pride and Prejudice
1342,away like other young men.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Perhaps we might be deceived.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when",Pride and Prejudice
1342,last at Pemberley.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards",Pride and Prejudice
1342,one of the windows.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There",Pride and Prejudice
1342,is nothing he would not do for her.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:,Pride and Prejudice
1342,but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,also more intelligible.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,father’s lifetime.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How,Pride and Prejudice
1342,much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good,Pride and Prejudice
1342,or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened",Pride and Prejudice
1342,its impropriety of expression.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself",Pride and Prejudice
1342,suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of perfect civility.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few",Pride and Prejudice
1342,minutes in which they continued together were some of the most,Pride and Prejudice
1342,uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,distraction of his thoughts.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took",Pride and Prejudice
1342,leave.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged",Pride and Prejudice
1342,thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if,Pride and Prejudice
1342,she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,account for it.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer",Pride and Prejudice
1342,reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,composure.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten",Pride and Prejudice
1342,miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered",Pride and Prejudice
1342,it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea,Pride and Prejudice
1342,lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said",Pride and Prejudice
1342,no more.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,fashion.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore",Pride and Prejudice
1342,it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some,Pride and Prejudice
1342,relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his taste, or his good manners.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love,Pride and Prejudice
1342,me.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours,Pride and Prejudice
1342,before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not very differently engaged.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance",Pride and Prejudice
1342,during your stay at Lambton?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great,Pride and Prejudice
1342,for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made,Pride and Prejudice
1342,him think really ill of her.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mile behind.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience,Pride and Prejudice
1342,and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,walking slowly towards the house.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them,Pride and Prejudice
1342,pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,_I_ have seen nothing of it.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more,Pride and Prejudice
1342,than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such,Pride and Prejudice
1342,attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are",Pride and Prejudice
1342,perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so,Pride and Prejudice
1342,disagreeable?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never",Pride and Prejudice
1342,seen him so pleasant as this morning.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,warn me off his grounds.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said",Pride and Prejudice
1342,nothing.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really",Pride and Prejudice
1342,should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!,Pride and Prejudice
1342,I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"master, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends",Pride and Prejudice
1342,every virtue.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth,Pride and Prejudice
1342,much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,[Illustration],Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own,Pride and Prejudice
1342,arrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such,Pride and Prejudice
1342,a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally",Pride and Prejudice
1342,suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction",Pride and Prejudice
1342,took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new,Pride and Prejudice
1342,acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from,Pride and Prejudice
1342,her beyond a monosyllable.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much",Pride and Prejudice
1342,relieved by discerning such different feelings.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected",Pride and Prejudice
1342,cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage,Pride and Prejudice
1342,than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what,Pride and Prejudice
1342,it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,evident enough.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleased.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!",Pride and Prejudice
1342,how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No",Pride and Prejudice
1342,look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On,Pride and Prejudice
1342,this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which,Pride and Prejudice
1342,gave them meaning.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw",Pride and Prejudice
1342,down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Rosings.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held",Pride and Prejudice
1342,there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some",Pride and Prejudice
1342,time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened,Pride and Prejudice
1342,into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"overlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very",Pride and Prejudice
1342,day of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been,Pride and Prejudice

1342,Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts",Pride and Prejudice
1342,which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves",Pride and Prejudice
1342,inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without",Pride and Prejudice
1342,calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold",Pride and Prejudice
1342,inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected",Pride and Prejudice
1342,them round the table.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,regret that he came.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely",Pride and Prejudice
1342,resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour,Pride and Prejudice
1342,when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?",Pride and Prejudice
1342,They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth,Pride and Prejudice
1342,instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming",Pride and Prejudice
1342,hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without,Pride and Prejudice
1342,meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern",Pride and Prejudice
1342,for the welfare of his friend.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely",Pride and Prejudice
1342,recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,brother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help",Pride and Prejudice
1342,repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we,Pride and Prejudice
1342,should not have known her again.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,summer.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see",Pride and Prejudice
1342,any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no,Pride and Prejudice
1342,brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants,Pride and Prejudice
1342,character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"without fashion, which is intolerable.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"determination of making him speak, she continued,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,a beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,one time.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”,Pride and Prejudice

1342,having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and",Pride and Prejudice

1342,Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How,Pride and Prejudice

1342,letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"no farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many",Pride and Prejudice
1342,circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married,Pride and Prejudice
1342,privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"again to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton",Pride and Prejudice
1342,again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,I have not an instant to lose.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how",Pride and Prejudice
1342,little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mistress home instantly.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you,Pride and Prejudice
1342,present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well, I am only distressed by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say",Pride and Prejudice
1342,something indistinctly of his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,[Illustration:,Pride and Prejudice

1342,     “I have not an instant to lose”,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"again. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It",Pride and Prejudice
1342,cannot be concealed from anyone. My youngest sister has left all her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him too,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Darcy was fixed in astonishment.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“When I consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,might have prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had",Pride and Prejudice

1342,all too late now.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"certain, absolutely certain?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced",Pride and Prejudice

1342,nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is,Pride and Prejudice
1342,such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had I known what",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him, as now, when all love must be vain.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,long as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"He readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"only one serious parting look, went away.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,formerly have rejoiced in its termination.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"first interview with its object, and even before two words have been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go",Pride and Prejudice
1342,with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched",Pride and Prejudice
1342,business. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry,Pride and Prejudice
1342,for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared,Pride and Prejudice
1342,incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy,Pride and Prejudice
1342,prey.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions",Pride and Prejudice
1342,raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now,Pride and Prejudice
1342,feel it!,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"importance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily",Pride and Prejudice
1342,settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,here when you sent for us;--was it so?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_That_ is all settled.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much",Pride and Prejudice
1342,more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form,Pride and Prejudice
1342,such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"friendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends,Pride and Prejudice
1342,would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not adequate to the risk.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe",Pride and Prejudice
1342,him capable of it?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,case?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that they are not gone to Scotland.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Barnet road.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"might strike them that they could be more economically, though less",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake",Pride and Prejudice
1342,forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what,Pride and Prejudice
1342,restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know",Pride and Prejudice
1342,nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,such a matter.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give",Pride and Prejudice
1342,greater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which,Pride and Prejudice
1342,are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every,Pride and Prejudice
1342,charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every,Pride and Prejudice
1342,sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity",Pride and Prejudice
1342,as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day",Pride and Prejudice

1342,relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He",Pride and Prejudice
1342,must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shire,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could,Pride and Prejudice
1342,be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added",Pride and Prejudice

1342,had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their,Pride and Prejudice

1342,been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its",Pride and Prejudice
1342,exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter,Pride and Prejudice
1342,would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"such a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived",Pride and Prejudice
1342,him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone,Pride and Prejudice
1342,should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too",Pride and Prejudice
1342,late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their,Pride and Prejudice
1342,income.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet",Pride and Prejudice
1342,could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that sum.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any,Pride and Prejudice
1342,message to her.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate,Pride and Prejudice
1342,speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was considered certain.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,importance.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,too far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this",Pride and Prejudice
1342,neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"imprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend,Pride and Prejudice
1342,it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they,Pride and Prejudice
1342,took place.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its",Pride and Prejudice
1342,unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,spot.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there,Pride and Prejudice
1342,seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other",Pride and Prejudice
1342,objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest,Pride and Prejudice
1342,kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there",Pride and Prejudice
1342,seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,should meet.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,there must be a triumph.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must",Pride and Prejudice
1342,have received benefit of greater importance.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,family.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,a couple who were only brought together because their passions were,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties,Pride and Prejudice
1342,that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved",Pride and Prejudice
1342,on quitting the militia.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are",Pride and Prejudice
1342,able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is",Pride and Prejudice
1342,an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she,Pride and Prejudice

1342,Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s,Pride and Prejudice

1342,Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with everybody, and had so many favourites.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’s,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Their sister’s wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister",Pride and Prejudice
1342,must endure.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"anxious, uneasy.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite",Pride and Prejudice
1342,so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,enough to provoke him.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,great while since she had been there.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth",Pride and Prejudice
1342,had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"impudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,colour.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led,Pride and Prejudice
1342,voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the world.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure",Pride and Prejudice
1342,I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,thought it would be very good fun if I was.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,smiled like anything.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her eldest sister,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,married woman.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,Pride and Prejudice
1342,from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring,Pride and Prejudice
1342,and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"breakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they,Pride and Prejudice
1342,may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t",Pride and Prejudice
1342,at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,will take care to get good partners for them all.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters",Pride and Prejudice
1342,behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,particularly like your way of getting husbands.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join",Pride and Prejudice
1342,his regiment at the end of a fortnight.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did,Pride and Prejudice
1342,think than such as did not.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of having a companion.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every,Pride and Prejudice
1342,occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did,Pride and Prejudice
1342,everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds,Pride and Prejudice
1342,on the first of September than anybody else in the country.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,curious to hear how it was managed?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little",Pride and Prejudice
1342,said on the subject.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven,Pride and Prejudice
1342,o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others,Pride and Prejudice
1342,were to meet us at the church.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether",Pride and Prejudice
1342,he would be married in his blue coat.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,well.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!",Pride and Prejudice
1342,I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised,Pride and Prejudice
1342,them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will",Pride and Prejudice
1342,ask you no questions.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"all, and then Wickham would be so angry.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"power, by running away.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,intended.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“My dear Niece,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     in his return, and, as Lydia imformed you, attended the wedding. He",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     children have been wanting me this half hour.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yours, very sincerely,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“M. GARDINER.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"produced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"just, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken",Pride and Prejudice
1342,on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard,Pride and Prejudice
1342,nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might",Pride and Prejudice
1342,assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence,Pride and Prejudice
1342,subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Wickham.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,as he joined her.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, she did.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“And what did she say?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned",Pride and Prejudice

1342,misrepresented.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other,Pride and Prejudice
1342,several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this,Pride and Prejudice
1342,time of year.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Very much.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,had said enough to keep him quiet.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,continue at least a twelvemonth.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for,Pride and Prejudice

1342,do.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us",Pride and Prejudice
1342,all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas,Pride and Prejudice
1342,himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are,Pride and Prejudice
1342,single.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper,Pride and Prejudice
1342,at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"smiled, and shook her head, by turns.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Philips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Meryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing,Pride and Prejudice
1342,colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present",Pride and Prejudice
1342,report; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes",Pride and Prejudice
1342,alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come",Pride and Prejudice

1342,him.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It",Pride and Prejudice
1342,would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can,Pride and Prejudice
1342,hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,always so much.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days,Pride and Prejudice
1342,that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"paddock, and ride towards the house.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"to the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down",Pride and Prejudice
1342,again by her sister.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,say that I hate the very sight of him.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time",Pride and Prejudice
1342,after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered,Pride and Prejudice
1342,behaviour in Derbyshire.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early",Pride and Prejudice
1342,enough for expectation.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period",Pride and Prejudice
1342,saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,her courtesy and address of his friend.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the",Pride and Prejudice

1342,applied.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question",Pride and Prejudice
1342,which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry",Pride and Prejudice
1342,with herself for being so.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,him she had hardly courage to speak.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,He readily agreed to it.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope",Pride and Prejudice
1342,it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,Pride and Prejudice
1342,since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"seen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,not tell.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"continued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done",Pride and Prejudice
1342,before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,moments of such painful confusion.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every",Pride and Prejudice
1342,five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that she did not always know when she was silent.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"good-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,had revived.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,decided. He placed himself by her.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He",Pride and Prejudice
1342,bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,alarm.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It",Pride and Prejudice
1342,gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table,Pride and Prejudice
1342,could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness,Pride and Prejudice
1342,made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the family.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,ever.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of",Pride and Prejudice

1342,do we?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,being so silly!,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?,Pride and Prejudice
1342,There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”,Pride and Prejudice

1342,The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the,Pride and Prejudice

1342,into the drawing-room.,Pride and Prejudice

1342,Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable,Pride and Prejudice
1342,addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,daughter.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably",Pride and Prejudice
1342,persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,concurrence.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more",Pride and Prejudice
1342,agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"everybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"other, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no",Pride and Prejudice
1342,other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"name to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of",Pride and Prejudice

1342,would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"Ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She",Pride and Prejudice
1342,heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings",Pride and Prejudice
1342,for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had",Pride and Prejudice
1342,only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had,Pride and Prejudice
1342,looked forward to as possible at some future time.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help",Pride and Prejudice
1342,feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting,Pride and Prejudice
1342,in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an",Pride and Prejudice
1342,application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar,Pride and Prejudice
1342,representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared,Pride and Prejudice
1342,not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose",Pride and Prejudice
1342,that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity",Pride and Prejudice
1342,unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to,Pride and Prejudice

1342,her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner,Pride and Prejudice
1342,connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He",Pride and Prejudice

1342,“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its",Pride and Prejudice

1342,of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"herself, when her father continued,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters,Pride and Prejudice
1342,as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says,Pride and Prejudice
1342,on that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus,Pride and Prejudice
1342,offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate,Pride and Prejudice
1342,may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"extensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"eye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force",Pride and Prejudice

1342,“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run",Pride and Prejudice
1342,hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,living together before the marriage took place should be so generally,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young",Pride and Prejudice
1342,couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should",Pride and Prejudice
1342,very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be",Pride and Prejudice

1342,in our turn?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so",Pride and Prejudice
1342,strange!”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man",Pride and Prejudice
1342,it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_,Pride and Prejudice
1342,pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and",Pride and Prejudice

1342,To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had,Pride and Prejudice

1342,repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by,Pride and Prejudice
1342,what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed",Pride and Prejudice
1342,their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"desperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"They walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"high, she immediately said,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving",Pride and Prejudice
1342,relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor,Pride and Prejudice
1342,sister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was so little to be trusted.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,sake of discovering them.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought",Pride and Prejudice
1342,only of _you_.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence,Pride and Prejudice
1342,me on this subject for ever.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The,Pride and Prejudice
1342,happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never,Pride and Prejudice
1342,felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as,Pride and Prejudice
1342,warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but,Pride and Prejudice
1342,though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection",Pride and Prejudice
1342,every moment more valuable.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She",Pride and Prejudice
1342,soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"every expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,your relations.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was,Pride and Prejudice
1342,unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,improved in civility.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such,Pride and Prejudice
1342,a way.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible",Pride and Prejudice
1342,way that would induce you to accept me.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at",Pride and Prejudice
1342,all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its",Pride and Prejudice
1342,contents?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"She explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her former prejudices had been removed.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"especially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly,Pride and Prejudice
1342,make you hate me.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily",Pride and Prejudice
1342,changed as that implies.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly",Pride and Prejudice
1342,calm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,dreadful bitterness of spirit.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The",Pride and Prejudice
1342,adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings,Pride and Prejudice
1342,of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance",Pride and Prejudice
1342,attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my,Pride and Prejudice
1342,philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you,Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasure.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent",Pride and Prejudice

1342,from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The",Pride and Prejudice
1342,acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,the family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one,Pride and Prejudice
1342,liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,you shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we",Pride and Prejudice

1342,you dislike him.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,did not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these,Pride and Prejudice
1342,a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,to do?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice

1342,Let me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds,Pride and Prejudice
1342,at Pemberley.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of,Pride and Prejudice

1342,further to wish.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"of it to another, not to you.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to,Pride and Prejudice

1342,her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,",Pride and Prejudice

1342,our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always,Pride and Prejudice

1342,way.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,epithet.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes",Pride and Prejudice
1342,hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has",Pride and Prejudice
1342,never seen the view.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"consented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"saying,--",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,disagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,asked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother,Pride and Prejudice
1342,would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur,Pride and Prejudice
1342,would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it",Pride and Prejudice
1342,was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to,Pride and Prejudice
1342,her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,disapprobation.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,But will they make you happy?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,indifference?”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,this would be nothing if you really liked him.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not,Pride and Prejudice
1342,know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,such terms.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on",Pride and Prejudice
1342,having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked",Pride and Prejudice
1342,up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing",Pride and Prejudice
1342,_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are,Pride and Prejudice
1342,about.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,match.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy",Pride and Prejudice
1342,had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have",Pride and Prejudice
1342,paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity",Pride and Prejudice
1342,would come in time.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"have thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages",Pride and Prejudice
1342,you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"pleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my",Pride and Prejudice
1342,dear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,Lord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her mother followed her.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman,Pride and Prejudice

1342,passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much",Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was,Pride and Prejudice

1342,sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did",Pride and Prejudice

1342,too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s,Pride and Prejudice

1342,"vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at",Pride and Prejudice

1342,arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her,Pride and Prejudice

1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near,Pride and Prejudice

1342,sisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"to Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with",Pride and Prejudice

1342,"known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s",Pride and Prejudice
1342,society she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of",Pride and Prejudice

1342,Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily,Pride and Prejudice
1342,drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but",Pride and Prejudice
1342,she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without,Pride and Prejudice
1342,much reluctance.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from",Pride and Prejudice
1342,the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"everything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be",Pride and Prejudice
1342,prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The",Pride and Prejudice
1342,letter was to this effect:--,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     /* “My dear Lizzy, */",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live,Pride and Prejudice
1342,     upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,     if you had rather not.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"“Yours,” etc.",Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or",Pride and Prejudice
1342,herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the",Pride and Prejudice
1342,extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to",Pride and Prejudice
1342,reputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when",Pride and Prejudice
1342,her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"Bingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_",Pride and Prejudice
1342,of giving them a hint to be gone.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility",Pride and Prejudice
1342,to Elizabeth.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters,Pride and Prejudice
1342,was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion",Pride and Prejudice
1342,in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open",Pride and Prejudice
1342,pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in,Pride and Prejudice
1342,her way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not",Pride and Prejudice
1342,always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.,Pride and Prejudice
1342,,Pride and Prejudice
1342,Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;,Pride and Prejudice
1342,"and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time",Pride and Prejudice
1342,"all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,",Pride and Prejudice
